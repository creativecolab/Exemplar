175,Eleutherios,"Eleutherios (https://eleutherios.org.nz) is a circular supply chain that lets people or businesses serve one another at scale via the internet. It does this by scaling or serializing the customers forum or request, so that one or more people, businesses or supply chains can serve the customer or in their forum at the same time.

# Problem

The current human supply chain is linear or tries to scale the service or work that people or businesses are trying to perform, not the forum, request or conversation that they are having. For example, if a person was hungry and had $10 to buy food, they might order online and spend $5 on a pizza, $2 on a drink and $3 to have the items delivered to their house.

In this scenario the person can only scale their request or conversation for food, three times. Once for pizza, a second time for a drink and a third time for a delivery service.

The problem is that the financial supply chain is the service that is doing the scaling of the request.

request = $5 (finance) for pizza (food)
request = $2 (finance) for drink (food)
request = $2 (finance) for delivery (logistic)

# Solution

Circularize or serialize the forum, request or conversation that people or businesses are having not the service or work that they are trying to perform.

By subscribing to the idea that service or work is constant, we can use that as the input for a computer or Turing machine to aggregate or output as a forum, request or conversation.

For example, if a person was hungry and isolated at home, they could register with Eleutherios and create a forum for some food. A food store owner could register as a service in the system and subscribe to the forum and ask the person what food they wanted? The food store owner could gather the food from their store and scale the forum by creating a sub-forum for a healthcare worker to help with the delivery of the food. The healthcare worker could scale the sub-forum again and create another sub-forum for a delivery service and accompany the delivery service and be the person that delivers the food to the isolated person.

In the above example, Eleutherios is scaling or delegating the responsibility for managing the forum or request to four different people, businesses or supply chains. The civilian, food, healthcare and logistics supply chain.

# Features

1. Forum in forum (sustainable/manageable).
2. Tags for filtering forums or services (searchable).
3. Alerts to keep users informed when new forums or services are created in the system (notifiable).
4. Blocking to prevent unwanted services or users from serving in forums they have been asked not to serve in or for requesting services, they have been asked not to request (accountable).
5. Service reviews (accountable)
6. B2B or shared processing (scalable)
7. AI (automatable)

Eleutherios is built with an HTML/javascript (Angular) frontend and node.js (nosql/firebase) backend. https://eleutherios.org.nz

With respect to the subscription model, I wanted the conversation to be in real-time, as if people we're physically in the same room together.

576,Stay Home Save Lives Challenge App,"In the U.S. it is up to each state to enforce a mandatory lockdown. It is proven that lockdowns will significantly ""flatten the curve,"" and save lives. We need to stop waiting on the government and OWN this responsibility. While people are ""staying inside,"" it is not enough. At the time of this writing on 4/12/2020 there are 1.8M cases, 113k deaths. The U.S. is the most alarming with 311k cases and 8500 deaths. We cannot WAIT for the government to take action, it is already too late. We need to build an app fast so that people take the pledge with us and join our movement. The app will use GPS to know if someone left their house or not. The idea is for each user to challenge themselves by staying in as long as they can. If they leave their home or a geofence, they are disqualified. Users will earn points by staying in everyday, and they can post to social media that they have ""Saved X Lives by Staying in for X Days."" Users will be able to set up groups and view leaderboards against their friends. They will also be able to set up ""Challenges"" similar to FitBit challenges. We will use gamification and incentivize users to almost NEVER leave their homes unless they desperately need to. We will get Companies to contribute and donate prizes. For example, if someone can complete 7 days of not leaving their home, they will earn a free 3-month subscription to Netflix. The second and third week of April is supposed to be the worst months. We have a limited window to build this and create something that may save the world. Join our movement as we are mobilized millions of people to take our challenge and pledge to stay home. *This app will be available for everyone in the world.*","Desi, Founder - Serial Entrepreneur

383,"Covid9teen.org (Updated: April 15, 2020)","tl;dr: 
SMS chatbot to prescreen potential covid-19 sufferers (based on existing protocols). Update: We shipped product in 3 days.

Join our Slack Group: 
https://join.slack.com/t/covid9teen/shared_invite/zt-czt2azr7-iYFqn_VZ39bydd1~SnSkVA

Problem:
Existing health services are overwhelmed by inquiries (web, phone, ER, etc). Many are false positives (feel sick, but not covid-19). This takes testing resources away from true positives (feel sick and positive for covid-19).

In British Columbia, Canada, our current health service provider takes about a day to reply from a human SMS operator. A chatbot is a practical application because the task is repetitive and follows a sequential set of rules.

Objective: 
Inform concerned citizens at scale and reduce the burden on healthcare professionals.

Solution (MVP):
Supplement human-operated SMS with a chatbot, which follows the same self-assessment protocol. In Canada, the self-assessment tool is near-identical across all provinces:  https://myhealth.alberta.ca/journey/covid-19/Pages/COVID-Self-Assessment.aspx

This SMS solution can be customized for your own regional health authorities. We are looking to expand to other communication channels (e.g. Whatsapp, messenger, Intercom, etc.)

Specifics:
User texts “I feel sick” to (587)210-2300. The ~8 question screening tool is based on Yes/No replies (boolean). 

To programmatically apply if/else statements, we're using Twilio Autopilot/functions. 

This is the abridged version of the ~8 question survey:
1. Are you experiencing severe difficult Breathing...Y/N
2. Are you experiencing shortness of breath...Y/N
3. Do you have any of the following: Fever, cough,...Y/N
4A. Were you exposed to someone who has been confirmed as having COVID-19 within 14 days of your symptoms starting? Y/N
5A. Did you travel outside Canada within 14 days of your symptoms starting? Y/N
6A. Have you been in close contact with someone with respiratory illness in the past 14 days? Y/N
7A. Had that person traveled outside of Canada within the past 28 days? Y/N
8A. In the past 14 days have you returned from travel to any other locations outside of Canada? Y/N

The current protocol has 3 possible outcomes: 
1. Forward to 911 (emergency services)
2. Forward to 811 (non emergency info line; your region may differ)
3. No testing required.

Deployment:
After building a proof of concept, share it and/or give it away to your local/regional authorities for free. We may request large organizations (e.g. government/corporations) to cover ongoing maintenance costs ($/SMS).

Update:
After 72 hours, we have launched the SMS - Congrats, team Covid9teen!

Product Development:
• Expand to other channels (e.g. Whatsapp, Messenger, intercom, etc)
• Shortcode SMS (e.g. Text ""I feel sick"" to 123123). Note: Applications for shortcode SMS take over a month for approval and costs >$1000. Source: https://www.twilio.com/shortcode/short-code-type
• Calculate the probability of a user having Covid-19 by taking the users input (e.g. symptoms, location, age, etc) and comparing it with known symptoms provided by the WHO. Source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOJqHPfG7pA

497,Eden - closing the educational gap,"With schools shut down and parents scrambling for educational keep their children learning, many kids, especially low-resource ones, are falling behind. 

We're seeing the inherent weaknesses in the educational system where without the supervision of adults, children just aren't motivated to learn.

What if we built an environment where kids pursue their passions to show mastery over material, explore their creativity, and build stronger social bonds with their friends?  

We're building a personalized, low-cost platform for passion-based learning. Educators create and share projects that are assigned to students. 

PAIN POINTS:
1) THERE IS NO EASY WAY TO MANAGE PASSION-BASED LEARNING. 
There is a ton of free projects available content online, but it is not curated and personalizable and requires a lot of teacher time to manage. On our platform, parents enter the age, interests, and language skills and we build a tailored project for their kids. They can also create and share their projects with others.  

2) CAN WE SOLVE CURATION & SUPERVISION? Yes. When kids are passionate about a project or problem, they require much less supervision. We add gamification so that course material is mastered at each stage. 

3) LOW-RESOURCE PARENTS AND KIDS WILL BE LEFT BEHIND. 1 billion kids are out of school. We are facing a critical widening of the educational gap; high-resource parents will be able to provide a rich learning environment at home but low-resource parents (low income, dual working parents, no internet access) will struggle.

636,#RunForFoodBanks,"Coronavirus (COVID-19) has created dire needs for food banks and community shelters around the world, as well as the people they serve. It's also helped many people rediscover or de-stress through running, a great outdoors social distancing activity. Most runners also participate in races, like 5K's, 10K's, and marathons, which are often used to raise money for their favorite charity or cause.

Inspired by people like Elisha Nochomovitz, a 32-year-old restaurant worker who ran a marathon (26.2 miles) on his 23-foot long balcony while on lockdown in France, and others looking to connect their love for service, running, and social distancing together, we're asking any runners out there to join us in a virtual race for food banks between May 15th - May 17th. You can run any time on any day during that period, but we want everyone to run together and post about it to get #RunForFoodBanks trending.

Your race course can be your backyard, your balcony, a treadmill, a park that isn't crowded, or anywhere you can maintain proper social distancing. The most important thing is the distancing, running (or walking or wheel-based movement if you need it), and making a positive difference.

All we ask is you donate your ""race entry fee"" to a food bank of your choice if you can. $20 is a good start, or as much as you feel you can give in this time of uncertainty (and if you can't give anything, running and sharing this helps too). What matters most is you're running for an important cause that matters to you, and that's inspiring you and others to be healthy and do our best. Here's a map and list of food banks to get you started, or choose your favorite local organization.

854,Headset negative ions.,"The following concept, involving the use of negative ions (created by small, wearable negative ion generators), has the potential to greatly limit the airborne transmission of Covid-19 within indoor settings.  More specifically, it involves the immediate air space of a person’s mouth and nose while indoors.      

In a nutshell, the negative ions weigh down any particulates in the air (including microorganisms) and cause them to fall to the ground.  Furthermore, there is research which indicates that negative ions can kill viruses outright.  If the negative ions from negative ion generators can indeed have these effects, they have great potential for limiting the exposure of people in buildings to any airborne Covid-19 in the area.  It is the indoor environment where the threat from airborne transmission is the highest, as Covid-19 does not do well in sunlight or in hot temperatures.     

Stand-alone negative ion generators, made primarily for home use, have been in existence for many years.  Of particular interest in presenting this idea are the versions companies have made which can be worn around the neck, as shown here:  https://www.npr.org/2016/05/12/477836061/in-polluted-india-negative-ion-necklaces-vow-to-help-you-breathe-easier ; http://www.businessworld.in/article/Air-Tamer-A-310-The-Personal-Air-Purifier-Device-Review/16-08-2019-174880/ ;  https://thegadgetflow.com/portfolio/wearable-air-purifier/ ; https://newatlas.com/sponsored-content/air-purifier-airbox-portable-indoor/ ; https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/constantinnov/airbox-more-powerful-than-hepa-purifiers (small, but not designed for wearing; this one also incorporates UV light).   

Negative ion generators have been mentioned very sparsely during the Covid-19 pandemic, even with the reported benefits.  Despite their negligible use, to date, there is sufficient research available (see later text) to suggest that active consideration of them in a smaller, portable form as a viable weapon against Covid-19 is merited.  

As indicated above, various companies have already invented wearable negative ion generators.  It is unknown whether or not these devices, if used as intended, would actually work.  In determining what would work, two specific concerns should be kept in mind.  First, we would want enough negative ions in the vicinity of a person’s mouth and nose on a constant basis to greatly inhibit the inhalation of live Covid-19 (in case a wearer is not infected).  This desired coverage area would be less than what is needed for exhalations.  Ideally, with a wearable negative ion generator, any Covid-19 lingering in the air would have already been neutralized if it had drifted near the face.  This assumes an indoor environment without a fan blowing nearby, or situations where a person is not walking.  Walking would quickly bring a person into new “environments” where any wearable negative ion device would not have time to have an effect on inhaled (or exhaled) air.  Second, in cases where a wearer is already infected, we would want coverage in the area beyond the mouth and nose where any virus particles from at least shallow or deep exhalations, or speaking, can be expected to reach before they attain a “lingering” or “drifting” status.  This would seem to pose more of a challenge than coverage of inhalations.  It seems reasonable to assume that the immediate dispersal area of a shallow or deep exhalation, or the act of speaking, would be considerably less than that of a sneeze or cough.  But once something has been expelled into the air, irrespective of the velocity in which it was done, it can stay in the air and eventually waft away many feet away from the person who exhaled.  As indicated above, this means we should strive for coverage of any area where an exhalation would tend to start lingering, while the person exhaling is sitting or standing still.  Thus, a larger coverage area than what would be needed for inhalations.  It would be too much to expect coverage of cough and sneeze particles; such acts can be addressed by another unique strategy (not discussed here).  

Having concluded that we need a coverage area to address exhalations and speaking, which would likely surpass the coverage area needed for inhalations, we would also have to consider whether or not a person is wearing a mask or respirator.  Since there is no guarantee that a person wearing the proposed device will simultaneously be wearing a face covering, the goal should be to address an uncovered face.  However, if exhalations of people wearing face coverings escape from the sides, the trajectories of such exhalations should also be taken into account.  

I have thus far suggested avenues for study.  It is unknown as of this writing whether or not the current portable negative ion generators on the market, where negative ion generators rest on the chest, would meet these expectations.  If they do, that’s great; let’s get more of them to the general public and simply adapt them with the design considerations discussed below.  However, I suspect they do not meet our expectations.  Therefore, I suggest the following:  (1) Design a version which can be worn like a telephone headset.  In this form, the negative ion generator would be positioned very close to the mouth and nose (similar to where a telephone headset microphone is located), not on the upper chest as in existing models.  This should bring maximum protection to where it is needed.  However, instead of having one negative ion generator positioned at the end of a headset arm, there would be two headset arms to respectively accommodate negative ion generators.  Another option would be to design a version somewhat similar to telephone holders that rest on the shoulder (     http://blog.modernmechanix.com/telephone-holder-is-curved-to-fit-contour-of-shoulder/ ) or chest (  https://www.urbanoutfitters.com/shop/adjustable-neck-smartphone-mount?inventoryCountry=US&color=001&size=ONE%20SIZE&gclid=EAIaIQobChMItqXeoYXL6QIVGMDICh3_bgPCEAQYHCABEgIoDfD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds&type=REGULAR&quantity=1 ).   In these examples, it is envisioned that the negative ion generators would also be positioned close to the mouth and nose.  In whatever design is chosen, the negative ion generators should not be directly in front of the mouth and nose.  If they are instead positioned to the side a bit, the wearer would be able to eat without having to remove the device.  (2) Concurrent with #1, above, studies should be performed on a rough prototype to confirm whether or not sufficient protection is afforded to the wearer (for inhalation) and others nearby (for exhalation).  If the latter is a bit deficient and it would be impossible to ramp up the power, research should factor in whether or not any Covid-19 which escaped entrapment or killing during an exhalation would be likely to also survive attempted inhalation by someone nearby who is also wearing a device.   (3) If a respected entity concludes after steps #1 and #2 that these devices could indeed be a significant contribution in the fight against Covid-19, I would envision that wearable, high capacity units that do not emit ozone could be mass produced and made available to the public.  I would urge that the Federal government put out bids for their manufacture.   

I should mention that another one of my concepts concerned the development of a face shield which partially consisted of Far UVC light, which can kill viruses in the air.  It might be worthwhile to consider adding Far UVC light in the vicinity of the dual negative ion generators, to form a “wall” that would kill Covid-19 in the process of being inhaled or any Covid-19 which is exhaled.  However, for inhalation, we cannot assume that air would enter in a straight line.  The inhaled air would come primarily what is in the immediate vicinity of the mouth or nostrils.  Therefore, for inhalation purposes, Far UVC lights would have to be positioned far enough away to “paint” the mouth and nose area, covering an area which would contain air that is likely to be inhaled.  Thus, it would not be two feet out, but perhaps inches out.  The light would also have to be like a spotlight, not a fine and narrow laser outlining a defined area.  Since Far UVC does not harm humans, one could argue that it should be pointed directly at the above mentioned facial areas.  But to be safe, a side to side illumination (headset arm to headset arm) might be better.  As for exhalation, we would need to see if the arrangement for inhalation would address the propulsive nature of an exhalation.  An exhalation would need to persist in the immediate vicinity long enough for the Far UVC to have an effect.  This may not be possible; research would tell.  However, an application of Far UVC to address inhalation might work.   

All we need at this stage is for someone to confirm whether or not the overall concept has merit and, if so, initiate efforts for mass production and distribution.  If this were to take place, all types of health care settings, work settings and entertainment/dining settings would be much safer for the people who work there.  They would also increase public confidence in the safety of such settings and, in turn, increase public patronage at such sites.  And that will be a tremendous boost to the economy.

877,COVID-19 Open Source Platform,"COVID-19 Open Source Platform

I am not a coder or programmer in any sense, I am just a political scientist that understands the value of collaboration and technology in the fight against covid-19. This platform (helpwithcovid) is the true example of a place where experts in technology unite to help others with their expertise. But what about the knowledge? Where is it stored? Who can have access to it? Can a person in Mozambique or Indonesia replicate the Corona Tracking software and deploy it at the same pace as an American or Chinese developer? What about good practices in many cities and countries that are being invisible just because they didn't reach the right communication channel?

I really believe that a open access approach is the only way in which we are going to democratize the fight against covi-19. There is no other way. 

There are some efforts like the the https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/ that are creating repositories of api’s and other code related to corona. This is a incredible page and all the environment that JOINUP has created since it launched is impressive, but there are several things to keep in mind: is very centered to the EU, is completely in english and is a passive repository, meaning that solutions and data are being sent to the page, then reviewed and then uploaded. What if we do the same but we add the secret element of proactiveness?

We could have the best platform in the world but if no one adds anything and at the end no one uses it, then what is the objective of nurturing the platform? We need to be proactive. We need a platform and a team of people that actively seeks partners, alliances, resources and communication channels to reach all of the possible stakeholders that could be interested in deploying this data or vice versa, trying to share their code with other fellow stakeholders.

So the project consists of two things:
A web-based platform that enables data sharing
A team of people that actively reach out stakeholders (e.g governments, networks, ngos, etc). 

What type of data while be available to upload?

Code
Socioeconomic and health data
API’s

252,Bluetooth stethoscope + pulse oximeter,"I am a frontline physician (hospitalist) that is seeing increasing volumes of patients at our facilities. PPE supplies are becoming increasingly precious and we expect we will need to mitigate PPE and equipment waste and develop new options for protection of our healthcare workforce.

One major item that is not discussed regularly on the news are disposable stethoscopes and pulse oximetry. In resource-rich countries, a patient on contact isolation will have a dedicated ""disposable"" stethoscope during their hospital admission. These are typically poor quality and of limited utility. They are also quite short -- resulting in close physical proximity to an ill patient, which increases risk of droplet contamination on PPE and individuals.

As with other supplies and equipment, I expect need will vastly outstrip supply due to the lack of machines and need to clean these items between patients.

I am asking all the talented people on this forum to help design an (1) inexpensive (2) Bluetooth-enabled stethoscope bell to reduce very-close proximity exposure for healthcare workers and enhance existing supplies chains for this medical equipment. I would prefer any designs be made widely available for any manufacturer to use if they agree to donate 90% of proceeds to medical relief organizations.","Existing companies produce electronic stethoscopes, though none natively broadcast to Bluetooth headphones.

868,Shiksha ,"Not every student has access to the internet and smartphones to avail of the benefits of e-learning. Our idea is to connect such students who are in need to the volunteer tutors through a simple phone call. They can discuss their doubts, the tutor can teach some lessons verbally and this way they can have one to one interaction with the tutor.
So many capable people are interested in helping society in these tough times. They can volunteer as a tutor denoting a small portion of their free time to teach these students.

Calling faculty(for students), backend(match and connect with a tutor), App(for the volunteers)

Features:
Vernacular/Regional language (Hindi)
One to one interaction

Simple Flow:
1. A student calls on a fixed toll-free number. 
2. He mentions the subject, class, and medium of his education.
3. Notification goes to relevant available tutors on the app.
4. The one who accepts gets the call.
5. The tutor solves the doubts.
6. Students and teachers give each other feedback.

Calling: 
A toll-free IVR(Interactive Voice Response) enabled number.
Asks name, class, and subject 

Matching and Connecting: 
Student calls and tells his/her subject, the tutor is searched in the volunteers who are online or who have filled the same preferred time.
We can also make some specific time slots. 

App for the tutors:
Registration/signup: data collection: name, qualification, subjects which he/she can teach, timings, how much comfortable in Hindi medium, etc. 
pdfs and material of NCERT and some standard government books. So that tutor can refer it while having a conversation with the student.
If a student of the same subject calls in the specified timing a popup notification is sent on the phone, if the tutor accepts, he is connected on call. 
In addition to the specified time, if the tutor is free, he can turn on the availability button, and he will get notified if any student calls.
After every call and feedback by the student, the tutor gets some points, which can be used as some kind of incentive to the tutor. 	`

Feedback:
Student feedback: At the end of the call, there shall be small automated feedback. The student will be asked how did they like the session? 
Tutor Feedback: In-app feedback feature.

498,CheckUpOnMe,"Please see our Github page! https://github.com/checkuponme/info

We’ve entered into these strange times where self quarantining alone and making sure you don’t leave the house without your mask and gloves has become the norm. Unfortunately what’s also starting to turn normal is the fear and anxiety that many people experience dealing with these situations that we’re now facing every single day.

The sad truth is, we have this rather large population of people who are much more susceptible to COVID-19 and the risk to them if they contract it is life threatening. Asthmatics, people with immune disorders, the elderly and even just people who are just badly out of shape. 

For this large but limited set of the global population, doing simple things that we all take for granted like getting groceries or getting the mail is now much more dangerous. On top of that, many people may not be fortunate enough to have others to rely on so they have no other choice but to take the risk in order to survive... Imagine that… Risking your life so you can get groceries.

That’s a situation that I don’t think anyone should ever have to be put in. That is the problem that we’re solving with CheckUpOn.me.

CheckUpOn.Me provides a peer-to-peer message and outreach platform for creating connections between volunteers, public safety professionals and people in need. During the COVID-19 pandemic our goal is to help where it's needed most by connecting people in need with volunteers and professionals who will be ready to take action. 

Our solution is built on top of the Open Source React and NodeJS project called Spoke. Spoke is an application that facilitates texting between end users and volunteers and is most well known for being used by grassroots political campaigns in the USA such as the Bernie Sanders Campaign and Elizabeth Warren Campaign for facilitating voter outreach.

CheckUpOn.Me is part of the Reach4Help.org family. There are a large number of organizations struggling with certain logistics, such as coordinating their volunteer workforce, prioritizing the most urgent requests, and ensuring that all requests get fulfilled. Reach4Help.org is an open project that aims to address these issues, by enabling those in need to receive help and enabling partner groups and organizations to help more efficiently by mobilizing their volunteers with the help of Reach4Helps relief management platform.

You can learn more about Reach4Help here: https://github.com/reach4help/reach4help.

While our current goal is to support the fight against COVID-19, our end goal is to help enable virtual civic collaboration for creating the cure for significant systemic risks to which adequate public and private solutions don't exist by rapidly creating and spreading a global, community driven, open source solution.

We’ve entered into these strange times where self quarantining alone and making sure you don’t leave the house without your mask and gloves has become the norm. Unfortunately what’s also starting to turn normal is the fear and anxiety that many people experience dealing with these situations that we’re now facing every single day.

The sad truth is, we have this rather large population of people who are much more susceptible to COVID-19 and the risk to them if they contract it is life threatening. Asthmatics, people with immune disorders, the elderly and even just people who are just badly out of shape. 

For this large but limited set of the global population, doing simple things that we all take for granted like getting groceries or getting the mail is now much more dangerous. On top of that, many people may not be fortunate enough to have others to rely on so they have no other choice but to take the risk in order to survive... Imagine that… Risking your life so you can get groceries.

That’s a situation that I don’t think anyone should ever have to be put in. That is the problem that we’re solving with CheckUpOn.me.

CheckUpOn.Me provides a peer-to-peer message and outreach platform for creating connections between volunteers, public safety professionals and people in need. During the COVID-19 pandemic our goal is to help where it's needed most by connecting people in need with volunteers and professionals who will be ready to take action. 

Our solution is built on top of the Open Source React and NodeJS project called Spoke. Spoke is an application that facilitates texting between end users and volunteers and is most well known for being used by grassroots political campaigns in the USA such as the Bernie Sanders Campaign and Elizabeth Warren Campaign for facilitating voter outreach.

CheckUpOn.Me is part of the Reach4Help.org family. There are a large number of organizations struggling with certain logistics, such as coordinating their volunteer workforce, prioritizing the most urgent requests, and ensuring that all requests get fulfilled. Reach4Help.org is an open project that aims to address these issues, by enabling those in need to receive help and enabling partner groups and organizations to help more efficiently by mobilizing their volunteers with the help of Reach4Helps relief management platform.

You can learn more about Reach4Help here: https://github.com/reach4help/reach4help.

--- What's next for CheckUpOn.Me

While our current goal is to support the fight against COVID-19, our end goal is to help enable virtual civic collaboration for creating the cure for significant systemic risks to which adequate public and private solutions don't exist by rapidly creating and spreading a global, community driven, open source solution.

We are in the process of developing teams, process, platforms, and solutions to support the most vulnerable populations in refugee camps, towns, villages, rural and marginalized communities that need urgent support, enable governments with information ahead of time, work with academic, and industry to partner on impact projects.

End Goal: Develop Website (SAAS) and App to implement data-driven solutions

Preparing for Disaster - It will happen again, what can we do now. 
In our AI Challenges, based on ML, AI, Blockchain concepts, we will test the systems, and help improve the programs, and or create new programs/solutions as needed in partnership with industry, academia, NGOs and government officials. The following are some themes we will keep in mind as we work on these projects.

A. The Science: How Disaster Could Start Again
B. The Organization: Survival of the Adaptive
C, The Leader: Leading for the Long Run
D. Preparedness: Emergency Planning Checklist for Communities
E. Communication: Getting Straight Talk Right
F. Modelling: Visualizing Your Vulnerabilities
G. Available Resources
H. Policy: What to Expect from Government
I. The Law: Limiting Exposure—of the Legal Kind
J. Test Case: A Preview of Disruption
K. Conversation: Staying Connected
L. Global Impact: All Eyes on the Starting Point

With these concepts in mind, think about ways we can do to improve the community's value to grow our communities. 
Here are 5 steps we can take prior to engaging on projects:

Step 1:  Understand what drives value for our communities during Emergency Preparedness
Step 2:  Understand our value proposition to whom we serve
Step 3:  Identify the community and segment (challenges or opportunities to improve) where are we can create more value relative to current systems/programs
Step 4:  Create a win-win situation for the stakeholders
Step 5:  Focus investments on our most valuable people/communities

We want to facilitate the exchange of solutions by opening up an open, public collaborative environment which is value-driven innovation. Service providers and researcher of solutions can directly post their details online, government and NGO organizations can post their urgent requirements, investors can fund vetted solutions, inexperienced professionals/graduates can obtain certifications, and be openly searched and browsed by anyone who has a demand, in a peer-to-peer fashion. We will also reference a complete list of open tenders/opportunities.

The platform will be subdivided into categories: Design, Test, Implement, and Evaluate phases.

14,CovidWire: Your neighborhood coronavirus news aggregator [UPDATED Apr 16] ,"The Problem

Making sense of the current COVID-19 environment requires piecing together hundreds of fragmented channels. This includes, but is not limited to, waiting for sluggish updates from the CDC, sifting through various Twitter feeds, or calling your friends for the latest on fear-mongering rumors. What if there could be a better way to be in the loop, without hunting through multiple channels?

The What

CovidWire is a curated news aggregator that provides real-time updates on the most important changes affecting your local community, so that you can stay informed and make rational decisions.

It's designed to counteract misinformation and rumors around Coronavirus spread through social media by highlighting what's truly happening locally, nationally, and globally around you. Determine wait times at your local hospital, see grocery store item shortages, and take actions according to municipality rules. Quickly learn what's happening to your neighborhood, plan decisions on the available local resources, and take action knowing you are informed to the best of your abilities. Stay informed locally. Act rationally.

Our government and donors are responding to the N95 need, but we need protection beyond masks.

The Solution: While disposable hazmat suits are not feasible and will run out, we decided to donate washable head to toe suits to add to the existing PPE. We instruct everyone to wear a disposable gown over it. We have received tremendous positive feedback from hundreds of healthcare workers.

433,ValueActs | Applying successful global solutions to local challenges.,"We promote what is working, and enable community leaders to match global solutions practices with available resources, for desired outcomes.

Over 120 million are anticipating the unfolding events and awaiting other's responses and actions. 

Businesses, communities, and organizations, find themselves not knowing where to find crucial knowledge or resources, leaving them lacking the vital capabilities needed to respond in an effective and timely manner.

Struck by demands to act swiftly, many are left alone trying as best they can to respond. For the majority, this means carrying out practical here and now solutions, regardless of the long term effects. 
Unfortunately, this results in the misuse of valuable time, resources and initiatives.

We are establishing an ecosystem around an abundance mindset that allows experts to extend their knowledge and best practices. 
The goal being that businesses, organizations, and communities get their needs met while helping others along the way. 
Together we grow and support each other.

We are here to resolve that by supporting and sharing global successful practices making it ready for quick and effective implementation locally for communities, businesses and social benefit for everyone.

We enable the best of all global initiatives/solutions, to be implemented at a local scale by community drivers utilizing community resources as well as local and global expertise. 
Together we can reach outcomes that enrich each other, saving Resources, time and lives altogether.


Main objectives
                          
Best use of Resources + Actionable Localized Solutions   =   
Aligned Outcomes with abundant use of resources and efforts.

Solutions: Taking what is working and building on it, 
We achieve that through Systems and community drivers 
sharing, mapping, and sourcing successful experiences, 
Assisted with technology, visual mapping for value realization.

Resources: improve the use of what is available. 
Saving development efforts, resources, mitigating risks 
while acting fast and getting things done.

We do that by:
- Modeling and mapping promoted Global succeeding solutions/activities, 
saving development efforts, resources, mitigating risks while acting fast and getting things done.

- Scaling operations and adjusting initiatives for 
local communities to be ready for implementation in a timely manner.

Anyone is capable of sharing his resources, knowing how to utilize that at once it is the key to getting things done.


The project is instrumental in enriching communities, partners, and shareholders all included.
When you are willing to share the success We multiply that again and again for you and for others.

545,UV-C Light cabinet to decontaminate used FFR masks ,"The current shortage of filtering facepiece respirators (FFR) might be alleviated if they could be reused by decontaminating them in a simple device - i.e. something a DIY person could build and supply to hospitals, GP surgeries, etc. There is evidence that a UV-C light cabinet might serve this purpose. This project seeks to encourage the production of such cabinets with the following key characteristics:

1) constructed from a design which has been tested for its effectiveness in decontaminating FFR masks against the SARS-Cov-2 virus as well as for its operator safety. Above all else the cabinet must be safe.
2) built at home using cheap, readily available components. DIY construction avoids the need for setting-up manufacturing facilities, distribution, etc.
3) checked for use at each location according to applicable regulations. The use of a DIY appliance at a hospital or GP surgery needs careful consideration, but at a minimum an electrician will need to check the cabinet is constructed according to the design and is safe to use.
4) used according to Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) for the design. A key part of the design is the production of clear instructions for the safe use of the cabinet which can be adapted for local requirements.

We envisage that multiple groups will undertake the development of a design and its subsequent testing. This project aims to support such groups by sharing information and providing common standards. We will also act as a central resource for DIY people seeking to select a verified design from which to build their own cabinets.

We are particularly interested in getting volunteers associated with Universities, particularly undergrads. This is because University labs are more likely to have the equipment and expertise necessary to undertake the testing and will hopeful support their own students in such a project.

We don’t know how many machines will fail once hospitals are truly taxed. We don’t know which parts of those machines are most at risk.

Some manufacturers heroically host service manuals for their equipment on their website, and some make them more challenging to locate. There is no single source of information for biomeds to access. Biomed forums are frequently populated with requests for specific PDF service manuals. The closest thing to a central resource is Frank’s Hospital Workshop, a fantastic website run out of Tanzania with hundreds of manuals and very helpful how-to resources for maintaining medical equipment. But Frank’s site is a one-person operation, and a single point of failure, should overwhelming traffic come calling.

We’re going to change that. Our biomed technicians’ time is too precious to waste on internet Easter-egg hunts. iFixit is building a central resource for maintenance and repair of hospital equipment. We need help from fixers everywhere, medical professionals, and biomedical technicians to make sure this is as robust, relevant, and useful as possible.

468,COVID-19 Antibody Test Kits for Health Care Workers,"Verboden Labs is helping hospitals and heath care clinics access highly reliable and cost-effective COVID-19 Antibody Detection Tests to test as many front line workers as possible. A test for antibodies that produces results within 15 minutes especially in people that didn't even know they had it, is a crucial part of the public health strategy and its impact could be enormous.

We need your help with the following tasks:

1. App developers to create an app that interprets test results
2. Identify and reach out to hospitals and medical clinics
3. Create infographics for social media posts and email campaigns

ABOUT THE TEST

The SARS-CoV-2 IgM/IgG Antibody Rapid Test is an in-vitro diagnostic immunochromatographic assay used in the detection of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies (IgM and IgG) in whole blood or serum from individuals who are suspected of COVID-19 infection but display little to no symptoms. With only two drops of blood from the fingertip, the test can determine the presence of immunoglobulins IgM and IgG, which are found in the blood of people who have been exposed to the SARS-CoV-2 virus. With clear results in 15 minutes, healthcare professionals can make a quick, reliable diagnosis without the need for a laboratory. Precious time will be saved that will help contain the further spread of the virus. This test is most accurate in detecting antibody levels in patients after at least 14 days after the onset of symptoms.

HOW IT WORKS

When the body is exposed to a virus, the immune system begins to produce antibodies to fight the virus and future infections from it. Those antibodies remain behind after the virus is cleared from the body, which the tests detect. This confirms a previous infection. These tests could be especially useful for determining whether health care workers have some immunity and are at lower risk if they go back to work. Unlike other COVID-19 tests, the CoV-2 Rapid test can also determine current infection phase. A positive IgM value indicates an infection in the early phase of the disease (4 to 10 days), and a positive IgG value indicates a later phase (from 11 - 24 days).

YALE UNIVERSITY STUDY

A Yale University study concluded that this test is suitable for detecting IgM and IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 with high levels of sensitivity and specificity. IgG specificity is near-perfect (99.7-100%) over the entire cohort of 1,892 patient samples. This finding provides reassurance that this test will minimize the chance for false positive results.

825,SANDESH,"SANDESH is a realtime tracking system software that can track multiple GPS and show the precise location of all GPS tracked on the google map.
Using this feature all the service providers which are appointed or authorized by State Government (eg. Vegetable seller, Dairy products seller, Ration Shop (Kirana), Meat seller, Sweepers, etc) can be registered on this app and their precise location would be displayed on google map and anyone having this app would be able to see their real-time location.


FEATURES :

1) Real-Time Tracking of Service Providers:

 -   Everyone having this app can see SERVICE PROVIDER'S location, which creates a sense of security in people.
 -   The black market could be stopped as people would buy goods from these authorized SERVICE PROVIDERS.
 -   On tapping the marker on the one could see the type of service being provided and contact details of the SERVICE PROVIDER.

2) State filter / Service filter:

  -  One can choose his state (eg Delhi) to see the details of Delhi only.
    SERVICE PROVIDER has to select his state of service and type of service.
    All the above filters are one tap filter without the requirement of typing manually.

3) Authenticate Delivery:

-    Every service provider can generate a QR code from this app, which will hold all the personal details about the service provider. This QR would be used by the delivery boy.
-    Whenever a delivery person appears on one's door, one can use this app to SCAN QR, which will search database, if a fake QR is presented, the user will be alerted that a fake delivery boy has appeared and would suggest not to purchase any product from him. Otherwise, the details of the service provider will be displayed on your screen.

811,Reducing the susceptibility to Covid-19 infection with well-research natural components,"It is common knowledge by now that a large proportion of the people who have contracted Covid-19 and were severely incapacitated, or died, often had concurrent medical conditions such as diabetes, heart disease, a history of smoking and so forth.  It is wise counsel for people currently with such conditions to take great caution when venturing out, encountering other people or entering new environments so that they may avoid getting infected.  

Most people with such conditions are under a physician’s care and receive appropriate treatment, from the perspective of traditional medicine as practiced in the U.S.  In this concept, I propose that physicians venture out a little bit more, into the domain of nutrition (and related fields), and explore whether or not the constituents of what people consume or fail to consume might have a bearing on if a person shrugs off Covid-19 or comes down with a full blown illness.  Some of these “fail to consume” components may not actually be commonplace in the average diet, at least at the levels that would be of benefit.  It could also be possible that a person actually consumes what would be deemed an adequate level of something, but a medication, some other consumed component or a medical condition may cause its depletion.  I will be proposing that the consumption of certain researched “natural” constituents, in supplement form, be promoted for long time and/or acute use, particularly among those at high risk.  This will be elaborated on below.   

As an enticement to this approach, I will be presenting some randomly discovered examples of components which might help in our fight.  They specifically relate to viruses, influenza or Covid-19 itself.  Please note that as to non-processed herbal candidates, even if they come across as appealing, I am excluding them from the list.  If they were to be distributed in their least-processed form on a massive scale, it would be exceedingly difficult for their quality could be monitored for any adulteration.  Furthermore, it is unlikely that the supply could meet the demand.  But herbal extracts might be subject to easier testing and greater trustworthiness.  

If this listing and the assertions made in the links concerning component benefits is found to be of interest, we would need a specific Federal agency or department to ensure that all available options will be considered for eventual public promotion.  One that comes to mind (there may be others) is the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health, at NIH.  
I suggest this endeavor be accomplished through the following:  (1) The involved agency or department would conduct an extensive internet article search, with a high reliance on medical, nutritional and other life science journals regarding potential candidates that could inhibit or actively fight viral infections, with a focus on influenza and, of course, Covid-19.  Such a search should involve human studies, animal studies, historical incidents/occurrences and theoretical assertions.   It should involve all nations and languages.  (2)  In pursuing this research, the involved agency or department should post all of the citations and sources it has discovered and will review.   It should also post a list of components that are under consideration and cross reference them with the articles as mentioned.  (3) Concurrent with #1 and #2, the involved agency or department should put out a global call to alternative / complimentary medicine providers, colleges and publications for any input or guidance they may have.  Even anecdotal sources would be considered.  The list as discussed in #2, above, should assist potential contributors in determining whether they have anything to add. (4)  While the preceding steps are taking place, efforts should be made to somehow acquire special blood work from patients with different levels of Covid-19 infections, such as:  infected but no symptoms; infected with symptoms but no hospitalization; infected with hospitalization (but a good prognosis); and infected with hospitalization and a poor prognosis (death likely).  Such blood work should be designed to detect specific deficiencies and possibly other factors, such as genetic elements.  (5) Once a list is in hand, as derived through #1 and #3, above, it is hoped that a consensus might arise within the medical community, including governmental entities with a medical orientation, that supplementing with all or some of the components which research suggests as being helpful would be worthy of consideration by individual physicians when consulting their patients.  (6) It is hoped that the Federal government could develop a list of the preferred components and put out bids for companies to manufacture them, in various formulations and dosages, for public distribution.  In doing so, information should be provided concerning any known risks in taking any of the components concurrently with various medications or medical conditions.  (7) Should distribution be effected, the blood work as described in #5 should continue, to see if the supplementation had any effect on those who participated.  This should be of tremendous benefit in addressing any other viral pandemics which should arise.  
Now for my list.  It is not exhaustive; view it as a mere sampling.

Qu Biologics, a Phase 2 clinical stage private biotech company based in Vancouver, has developed a first-in-class immunotherapy platform, Site Specific Immunomodulation (SSI), that enables activation of innate immunity in a safe and targeted way.  This is particularly important in high risk groups such as the elderly, immunosuppressed and those with other chronic illnesses, since these groups have reduced innate immunity and therefore are very susceptible to infection, morbidity and mortality from COVID-19. 
  
We’ve demonstrated that prophylactic use of Qu’s SSI substantially reduces viral lung infection in animal models, demonstrating proof-of-principle. Qu’s SSIs are ‘clinic ready’ (i.e., more than 360 patients treated with very good safety profile, GMP cell bank, and GMP-production ready). Uniquely positioned to activate our body’s first line of defense against viral infection in a safe and targeted way, we believe that Qu’s SSIs will be transformative in COVID-19 and future viral pandemics (since innate immunity is capable of clearing any viral pathogen, regardless of previous exposure).

A team of data scientists, engineers, and designers in partnership with epidemiologists, and public health officials built a tool [https://covidactnow.org/] designed to spur state and local governments into action to arrest the spread of the coronavirus. 

This tool was built to enable political leaders to quickly make decisions in their Coronavirus response informed by best available data and modeling. It is now being used by government and covid response leaders to answer critically important questions such as:

- What will the impact be in my region be and when can I expect it?
- How long until my hospital system is under severe pressure?
- What is my menu of interventions, and how will they address the spread of Coronavirus?
One critical request is from a federal government agency hoping to use this model and some of the presentation elements to help coordinate crisis response efforts (i.e. where to send masks).

The platform is also being extended to support government agencies, medical device manufacturers, and front-line health providers plan for and respond to covid.

360,SafeSlot - Getting Essentials Safely During Crisis,"In these days of the crisis, one of the biggest problems is buying essentials - food and medicine. Wherever you go, there are big queues for stores or overcrowded stores. With less enforcement of social distancing, people are not confident about going to stores. Over that, a lot of stores are closed or operating for a lesser duration than normal.  

Our solution to the above problems is to 
- Evenly Spread Customer Visits at Different Times
- Provide Customers with correct and updated opening status and information
- Providing Customers with a Proof of Essential Travel (if any law enforcement agency asks for it)

Our app, SafeSlot helps in implementing these solutions. When user opens the app, they can see the nearest stores based on their location. We plan to divide the store timings into various time slots with a maximum cap of registrations based on the store/counter size and let users book the slot for their essential shopping. For the same, users can book a maximum of two slots per day for any store. We also have an option of DriveThru option in which users can upload their grocery list/doctor's prescription and stores can pack it by the time they arrive at the store.

813,Improvements in UVC and Far UVC approaches to help reduce the airborne transmission of Covid-19. ,"By now, many who have been following the development of Covid-19 have become aware that UVC light (or Germicidal UV) can kill it, on surfaces and in the air.  Since UVC light is harmful to humans, it is difficult to see it having a role in settings where people can easily be exposed to it.  Thus, I will not be discussing any attempts to clean person-level surfaces by UVC light while people may be in the vicinity.  However, its role in cleaning the air will be discussed in depth.   An alternative option, Far UVC, will be brought up in later text. 

UVC light has been used for many years to eradicate microorganisms from the air of buildings.  Units are usually installed within duct work, or on walls at least seven feet from the ground with shielding to prevent eye damage to people nearby (upper air irradiation).   The wall unit lights point outward at an angle and upward, often towards a ceiling air vent.  The following describes these type of arrangements:  https://www.achrnews.com/articles/141736-how-hvac-can-help-prevent-the-spread-of-contagious-diseases  .

If a building has units as described above, it is already having an effect on the airborne transmission of Covid-19.  Perhaps the effectiveness of what a building has established can be verified by testing.  However, there may be ways to improve the quality of their respective campaigns even further.  In addition, in buildings where no such systems are in place, possibly due to costs, there may be ways to bring them into the fold through other approaches.  I will be proposing approaches to address these two situations (increasing current UVC  measures or starting UVC measures) that will not only attain the respective goals, but also have the added benefit of being publicly visible.  The visibility of UVC efforts (evident in the preceding only in upper air irradiation) is extremely important, for it will give the public greater confidence that various settings are indeed safe from the perspective of airborne transmission.  This, in turn, will have a tremendous effect on the economy.  I cannot stress this point enough.

It is reasonable to assume that if the owners of a building wanted to install the above mentioned systems, they would do so.  However, they may be deterred by the costs.  The main high level expenses would likely involve expensive wiring.  I therefore propose that manufacturers be urged to create UVC options which could adapt to existing fixture or wall outlet placements.  

Let us first consider ceiling light fixtures.  They would generally fall into the following categories:  (1) recessed bulbs; (2) bubs in fixtures that are close to the ceiling; (3) hanging light fixtures; and (4) recessed, long bulb fluorescent light fixtures.  There might be a few more types, but this should suffice for our discussion.  The height of ceilings should also be taken into account and will be touched upon, below.  

You can’t simply replace the current bulbs involved in #1 - #4, above, used for lighting, and install a UVC bulb or fixture.  Such a replacement would, of course, have to be pointed upwards.  Yes, it would provide protection, but the inhabitants of the room below would have lost a good amount of their needed illumination.  The solution would be to create hybrid fixtures which would piggyback onto the existing fixtures.   For example, with #1, a screw in connection to the existing bulb receptacle would hang down and feed power into a new fixture, below, which would have been attached to the ceiling.  This new fixture would have a UVC component, shining upwards and laterally in a manner which cannot be seen by people below.  On the bottom side would be the bulb for illumination.  This whole fixture would be stabilized by non-obtrusive struts connecting on the lower surface of the ceiling.  If the ceiling had fire prevention tiles, a way to attach to the visible tile holders would need to be devised, without having a negative impact on the integrity of the tile system.  Whatever is designed would need to meet fire code standards.  As for #2 fixtures, they would be addressed in a manner similar to #1.  With #3, the hanging fixtures would remain at the same level, but a UVC fixture would be added higher up.  There would need to be some assurance that the UVC light would not tilt if it is not attached to the ceiling.  As for #4, a new fixture would need to be suspended from the ceiling just below it.  UVC bulbs (with proper shielding) would be installed in the recessed fixture.  The wiring would need to be fixed so that both lamps would be powered.  

Assuming all of the original fixtures were reasonably spaced from one another, the suggested alterations would provide good UVC coverage close to the ceiling.  That is good for that part of the room, but the protective effect would be much better if the “dirty” air from below circulates up to the ceiling area for cleaning.  Any vents already in the ceiling would help effect this.  So would ceiling fans, which may need to be installed in tandem with the above mentioned fixtures.  This would probably not be a problem in low-ceiling rooms.  However, if the involved room had a very high ceiling and a broad expanse, this would be difficult to imagine happening.   One thing which could help in high ceiling situations would be long pipes extending downward from the ceiling and terminating in light fixtures.  These pipes could have openings on the lower end designed to suck air upwards and dispel it in the ceiling area to be hit by the UVC.  Although conceivably workable, the cost would likely be excessive.    

Thus far we have spoken about ceiling fixtures.  And we are already aware of conventional upper air irradiation.  If a room had a very high ceiling and outlets were available on the wall, it might be possible to create an artfully disguised stacking of traditional upper air irradiation devices, from a height of seven feet on the wall on up.  Then, in order to get air fed into the units, we would have built into this array a long “pipe” suction system behind the lights.  This would suck in a high volume of air for cleaning.  It would exit at the top.  Or, if it is possible, piping from a major design component or sculpture at ground level in the center of the room could circulate air from that site, beneath the floor and then upward into the stacked array.  This would likely cost a bit.  

So far, I have presented options involving open areas with high or low ceilings.  I will now discuss how the air could be further cleaned by a different type of light, Far UVC, to the benefit of people sitting at tables, desks or standing at counters.  If added to the above discussed options, a building would appear to be capable of making the airborne transmission of Covid-19 virtually impossible.  This options would also go far in reinforcing in the public mind that the risk of contracting Covid-19 there would be extremely low.  

Now, a little background on Far UVC light.  I will be borrowing a bit from what I had written elsewhere for another idea.

First, UVC light as discussed above is harmful to humans.  It is not safe to look into such a light.  There is however, an alternative :  Far UVC.  It has the same very rapid killing effect, but research so far suggests that it will not harm the human body.  The following provides insights on UVC:    https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20200325-covid-19-the-history-of-pandemics ;    https://www.digitaltrends.com/news/can-uv-light-kill-coronavirus/ ;  https://www.rfsafe.com/207-222-nm-uvc-light-can-slow-spread-of-novel-coronavirus-covid-19/ ; https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-21058-w  .  This suggests the Far-UVC can be emitted by LED:  https://www.news.ucsb.edu/2020/019860/power-light ; https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/uvglo-the-world-s-smartest-uv-c-led-sterilizer#/ ;  If Far UVC can be made with LED, then the design of what follows will be augmented.

Although Far UVC light is said to not harm eyes, out of an abundance of caution I am proposing options that will not involve a steady shining of the light into people’s faces.  

I propose the following:  (1) Far UVC lamps could be designed for placement in the center of tables, as a fixture.  They would be angled downward so that the light would terminate at the table’s edge.  This would have a direct effect on the air in the immediate vicinity of dines.  (2) Far UVC lamps could also be designed for placement on counters, such as at banks and the indoor pick-up window in a restaurant.  These would be angled downward in a manner similar to #1 and also only shine to the left and right.  (3)  If there was a guarantee that a setting would not allow children, such as bars and nightclubs, Far UVC could shine from walls, columns and barriers from the ground up to about four feet.  (4) Salad bars could have horizontal lights which shine away from the customer, at an angle, along the entire length of the salad bar (at waist level).  This could also be done with conference tables.  (5) Upward pointed, horizontal Far UVC lamps could be affixed along the upper borders of office cubicles.  (6) Far UVC lamps could outline the entrance to an office door, effectively cleaning any air which drifts in or out. (7) Since stays in elevators are relatively short, consideration could be given to downward pointed Far UVC lights in elevator ceilings.

All of the above mentioned UVC and Far UVC options would clean the air immensely and, of great importance, would be so visible that the public would feel more assured.  The public could continue wearing masks, but there would be less fear in these settings.

Since manufacturers are already making UVC and Far UVC components, they do not need any encouragement in their development of particular fixtures.  However, what is needed is a high-level request from the government to consider making the types of devices as described above.  Such a request would be magnified even further if all of the industries that have been severely affected by Covid-19 were to clamor for the production of such options.  They would know that if these systems were in place their employees would be safer and the public would feel far safer in patronizing them.

84,Novel Vaccine Candidate via Mammalian Cell Production ,"Stark Therapeutics is producing a recombinant viral protein from SARS-CoV-2 in order to create a CTL dependent immune response to stop productive infection. To date, this represents a novel approach to vaccine development. For initial POC and toxicology studies, being conducted in coordination with BASi, we are using transiently transfected suspension adapted HEK293 cells. For long term production, stable transduction will be achieved with a Lentiviral system. Stark Therapeutics is partnering with Perception Biosystems and was funded by WeFunder’s ""Fight the Virus"" challenge.

695,My Private Medical Credentials,"Delivers instant, privacy protecting digital verification of medical test results on any mobile device, using distributed ledger and open source cryptographic standards supported by governments (e.g. USA, Canada, UK) and global companies (e.g. Hyperledger, Mastercard, IBM).

Global economies have been disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic, forcing the shutdown of businesses, and creating millions of unemployed workers. Although wide range of testing is available and increasing daily, no large scale service exists that easily proves a person’s test results to others. This gap creates huge uncertainty for anyone to know if an individual should be permitted to conduct everyday activities (return to work, schedule dental or personal hygiene appointments, visit nursing homes, work as an Uber driver, fly on a plane, etc.). Testing alone does not deliver trust – verifiable virus credentials on a person’s immunity status immediately ensures trust to everyone - employers, workers and consumers.

Private Medical Credentials returns people to work, by enabling them to instantly and easily prove to any person or organization the results of a COVID-19 test, using their smart phone or computer. Private Medical Credentials preserve total privacy of personal information. Our COVID-19 Verifiable Digital Credential is free to anyone who has a COVID-19 test result from a government approved testing service.

There are several excellent examples of infection/death/recovery trackers and maps that provide guidance on the status of the pandemic progression, but it is also important to disseminate accurate information with appropriate caveats and epistemic humility on the progress (or lack thereof) of a potential vaccine and treatments for COVID-19.  This would help governments, organizations and businesses better plan in accordance with the estimated timelines and likelihood (or lack thereof) of a potential vaccine, and help understand the timelines for potential treatments, partly so that we can plan the extent of containment efforts (e.g. if trial results for treatments are around the corner, it will motivate stricter containment efforts in the short term).

262,"Remote detection of vital signs (respiration, HR, HRV) for remote symptoms analysis and tracking ","Please see our new website (launched April 12, 2020): https://www.vitalsign.ai/

Problem:
The detection of COVID-19 symptoms requires doctor and hospital visits, or a visit to test sites outside from home. This results in possible transmission or infection of COVID-19, and an increase of doctor visits straining the medical resources available. 

Solution:
Prognosis, diagnosis and screening for the patients infected with COVID-19 is suggested to be based on breathing characteristics (Wang et al. 2020. https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.05534) as well as other vital signs such as blood oxygen saturation/hemoglobin levels (https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/03/200330152135.htm). 
The detection of vital signs can be achieved via facial cameras and machine learning for breathing patterns (Chen et al. 2019 https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.03503.pdf), hemoglobin levels (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6371334/), HRV and others (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6396075/). 

The proposed project is an app that can be installed and used on any smartphone and laptop to detect early symptoms of COVID-19 remotely without leaving the home. As well as for monitoring (ongoing interest from healthcare and medical institutions already). 
It uses the detection of vital signs and breathing characteristics via technological devices accessible to everybody at home with cameras of smartphones/laptop and machine learning, and combines it with the detection of pearly symptoms. 
The app user will also be able to use therapeutic exercises such as aerobic, mindfulness and belly breathing (https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/20/style/self-care/isolation-exercise-meditation-coronavirus.html). Often, many exercises require additional app use, and are therefore not accessible and as widely used among elderly, vulnerable and people in under-resourced communities. The app will enable an inclusive and accessible use, in combination with vital sign detection. So for the therapeutic part of the app, the vital sign provides a measurement of progress, for instance by showing a reduction of average heart rate, improvement of hemoglobin levels or deeper breathing patterns. Vital signs can offer a quantification of stress levels and progress of health for motivation, too. 

The app can also include information on resources to reach for the nearest hospital, doctor and pharmacy. 
As well as resources for communal support and connection to nearest online groups, help for grocery delivery etc. ","Please see our new website (launched April 12, 2020): https://www.vitalsign.ai/

Breathing.AI has been using the laptop or smartphone camera with machine learning to detect vital signs such as heart rate in our prototypes developed at MIT Media Lab and NEW INC since 2018 (https://youtu.be/0ypXPvQXWtk). The app would use some of our existing research and development (such as for the online prototype www.coloring.ai), and collaborate with the researchers to improve the accuracy and testing opportunities with NYU resources. Atashzar and his lab add machine learning capabilities and testing for symptom analysis, Hegde and his team improve the computer vision problems, Goldstein and her team is an advisor of Breathing.AI and consulting on regulatory compliance for the data, and Ben van Buren and his lab are providing additional research and development capacities. 
The app would be developed via remote research and development and could also be tested via remote downloads from people at home, as well as from medical professionals at NYU Langone Health hospitals the NYU researchers are connected to. The app offers a remote detection, and the data would be shared with doctors to evaluate if treatment and in-person visits on site are necessary.

***Problem: COVID-19 Will Cause Staffing Shortages***
***Idea: Professionals have spare time to volunteer to hospitals***
***Solution: Website that connects professionals to hospitals in need***

Our goal is to connect medical providers to hospitals with staffing shortages caused by COVID-19.  Italy & France have shown us the importance of being able to increase hospital capacity quickly.  In addition to nurses & doctors, facilities will need technicians, schedulers, admins, etc. 

We are building a centralized location where hospitals can request services, and anyone with a medical skillset can offer their time.

***Roadmap***
With current projections, the largest strain on the healthcare system will come 2-4 weeks from today.  To get ahead of the curve we are executing a version of the following plan - 

Week 1 - Build Intake for Volunteers & Hospitals (COMPLETE)
Week 2 - Begin to Match Volunteers to Jobs (NEED HELP NOW)
Week 3 - Continue enrollment & Run Support Operations
Week 4 & Onward - Develop features facilities are asking for. 


We launched our beta targeted at physicians before the Coronavirus pandemic and can be viewed here: https://apollohct.com

Tech & Non-Tech volunteers welcome.  Together we can mitigate staffing shortages and save lives.  
","Apollo was founded by 2 medical students, Jon (CEO) & Matt (Head of CX), at the University of Iowa.  Our third cofounder Christian (COO) was previously an IT Director at AB-Inbev.   Development is currently outsourced to a local agency. 

Mentors include: Dr. Richard Ferguson (Former CEO ACT Testing), Alec Whitters (CEO HLT Forbes 30 under 30 winner), Matt Rooda (CEO Swinetech also Forbes 30 under 30 winner), Bruce Guyant (former head of physician recruitment at CHG (largest staffing agency) and now head of recruitment for Cristus Health,  Suresh Gunasekaran (CEO of U of Iowa Hospitals)

We raised our first round of Angel Funding Q1 of 2020. ","Non-Tech volunteers welcome. 

Tech side, our MVP product serves as an intake system that can readily match providers with hospitals. Current tech stack is PHP & React.  To aid in coronavirus efforts we would need to build additional features:

- Matching System (Currently Manual) 
- Provider Intake Form
- Upload Download of Documents
- Map of Jobs

ANYONE can help here, but volunteers with PR attention and other marketing & social media expertise are particular needed to help make this happen quickly - we have no time to waste getting this free valuable information on the site to the masses. 

 The secondary goal is to encourage crowdsourcing submission new site and realtime correction of site information on an ongoing basis.  This requires: 
  - a social media campaign to the general public to all donate 5 minutes for the cause and enter a site they know from their local news.  We need help building, funding and maintaining this.  
  - recruitment of 1-2 volunteers to represent EACH COUNTY of the US to a) collate information on their local testing sites, b) keep on top of accuracy and c) advocate for more locals to join the fight. Please volunteer and step up for that responsibility as the majority of the 3000 or so US counties still have 0 reported testing sites on the website - that needs to change ASAP.  Please check https://testingforcovid.com/newSite whether YOU are in a county of zero.

> Data collection, data quality control and data entry volunteers:

As drive through testing becomes more mainstream and the public begin submit corrections and feedback in earnest, we are looking for volunteers to:

- monitor local news for announcements of new sites
- enter the new sites 
- check the sources and verify submissions 
- implement corrections to dataset.

719,CoCo (Corona Control) - Closed Loop Pandemic Management System,"For any system to adapt well to the problem at hand, it needs feedback. CoCo (Corona Control) is such a closed loop system. It operates on anonymized crowdsourced data.

CoCo consists of 2 parts: the CoCoMed app and infomed.live
The CoCoMed app is designed to overcome the primary problem of contact tracing apps, that both users need to have the app. Bluetooth based contact tracing needs around 60% of the local population to adopt the app for viability. We believe this threshold is untenable. We are using GPS data to overcome this threshold. The combination is used to prospectively identify vulnerable zones where infection can spread fast. This data can be used to direct testing/fumigation efforts in an informed manner. This platform is also well suited to large-scale clinical research. We collect basic health and medication data. This is used to identify co-morbidities and drug interactions on a large scale from identified cases. A symptom tracker is included for primary screening, following which where is an option to schedule tests and self-report in a verified manner. CoCoMed is a privacy-first app. We are using the TCN protocol for bluetooth and have developed an algorithm for private and secure GPS data transfer. Details can be found on our github page(readme).

Infomed.live connects hospitals and health authorities. Hospitals update their inventory, patient load, personnel status, etc on the platform for authorities to view. Infomed also integrates with the CoCoMed app to help users schedule tests with hospitals and testing centers. We aim this towards reducing overcrowding at hospitals and reducing the risk of spread. This mechanism also helps verify self-reported cases, an important feedback feature.

       The Outdated Approach of Competitors
Test Prep by Attrition: the more hours/money one spends studying and practising past questions, the better off you are. (Is this true of anything anymore?)
The more content you can cover through prep, the better. (Is all content really of equal value?)
The best way to prep is to practice old tests from start to finish. (How does this drill down towards the most essential skills and test prep needs?)
If you want 1-on-1 individualized help for a test, break the bank for high priced tutors - often from $100 to $1500 per hour. (Is it only those with great means who should have access to this support?)
Get a different App or test book for each exam that you take. (Is that really necessary? Why can’t we have an all-in-one App like DuoLingo for test prep?)
App test prep programs look very much like mobile versions of the old books. (What if we used the best in AI, Gamification, AR and even VR to made test prep as fun as video games…could we imagine the gains that we would see in skill development if we took the slog out of test prep?)

858,Mobile strategies to counter airborne Covid-19,"In considering current options to protect against the indoor airborne transmission of Covid-19, in settings where people regularly transit, the current available options are:  (1) Masks or respirators (being commonly used); (2) Stationary placements of negative ion generators; UVC light or Far UVC light (none of which have yet become commonplace); and (3) Personal (wearable) devices emitting negative ions and/or Far UVC light (only a less-refined version available, in minimal use).  

The varied concepts in this narrative puts forth strategies to expand the indoor use of negative ions, UVC light and Far UVC light in intensities much greater than would be possible in personal wearable devices (#3, above), thus providing wider protective coverage.  Furthermore, these concepts will enable a greater focus on the “human level” environment, where some of the proposals for stationary placements (#2, above) may not be able address in a sufficient manner.  Also, if the approach of #2 is not implemented in various settings, the approaches in this narrative will at least allow a comparable level of protection, either in large areas of buildings (A and B , below) or in the immediately surrounding environments of individuals (C, D and  E, below).

As alluded to above, the use of negative ions, UVC light and Far UVC light can help substantially in the fight against airborne Covid-19.  Links at the end of this presentation provide evidence of this.  

The strategies being put forth fall into the following categories.  First, we have options which would have a very high output (similar to #2, above).  This would involve:  (A) Robotic (“Roomba”) roaming devices; and (B) Wall and/or ceiling mounted “rail” systems.  Next, we have options that would have a greater output than #3, above, but not as much as #2, above.  That would involve:  (C) Wheelchair mounted devices; (D) “IV pole / umbrella” devices; and (E) “Lap tray” devices.  The use of any of these devices, A – E, will depend upon the nature of any environment under consideration.  

The robotic (“Roomba”) device (A) would generally consist of a tall, roaming column supporting negative ion generators and/or UVC light and/or Far UVC light.  Ideally, the column should not take up much floor space, as a large footprint would interfere with people passing by.  But that would cause stability problems.  Therefore, there would need to be a track positioned high up on the walls in hallways and large rooms.  These tracks would allow carriages, connected by cable with the column, to move along them.  The column would be able to adjust the tension on the cables as it moves from halls to rooms, etc.  If a person tried to knock over a column, the cables would tighten and the column would remain stable.  Special provisions would be needed if a room has columns.  This system would likely not be suitable for entering rooms through doors.  Overall, this system would be suitable only in hallways, aisles and lobbies.  This system could emit negative ions in all settings.  If it had motion detection and body warmth detection capabilities, it would be able to emit shielded UVC light (which is harmful to humans) in the absence of any people.  For example, in a hallway, the UVC light would be pointed to the side walls, not down the hallway; it would not shine into open doorways or office windows.  It could illuminate areas below seven feet off the ground, an ability which is not allowed with unattended stationary UVC lights (unless they had sensors).  If a person comes into range, the motion and body heat detection abilities would cause the UVC light to turn off.  It could shine Far UVC light, in all directions, virtually anytime.  It could refrain from pointing UVC light directly at the end of a hallway.  In essence, this arrangement could perform constant “sweeps” of the indoor environment and reach places with greater intensity than possible with stationary devices.  

Careful consideration would be needed for the placement of such devices.  Offices, big box stores, universities, airport concourses, some medical facilities and houses of worship would seem to be likely candidates.  Schools and other settings where attempts at vandalism are likely would probably not do well with this.

Wall and/or ceiling mounted “rail” systems (B) would bear some similarity to robotic “Roomba” devices, in that a tall column would deliver the same protective technologies as mentioned above (including human detection).  The distinction is that they would run on wall or ceiling mounted rails that keep the column close to a nearby wall at all times.  This would greatly inhibit any attempts at vandalism.  The drawback is that the path used by the columns would need to be kept clear at all times.  

This system would likely find suitable placement in school hallways, office hallways, the walls and possibly aisles of auditoriums, etc.

Wheelchairs (C ) and similar mobility aids would also provide a good platform for protection and would perform a valuable service in places like nursing homes, by supplementing, to a degree, any stationary protective devices they may have in place.  This approach would require the design of a battery-powered system which provides protection, does not present a safety hazard, is durable and will not interfere with a wheelchair user getting in or out of the wheelchair.  It would not carry UVC light emitters; only negative ions and/or Far UVC light would be supplied.  Various approaches to the design of the emitters could be entertained, but they would likely entail either being housed in “columns” rising up from the vicinity of the handles which people use to push wheelchairs, or from an overhead “umbrella”, supported by columns as just described.  Any design would need to take into account the need of wheelchairs to collapse inward for transport (on occasions) and the occasional need to carry a patient in a medical transport van.  

Consideration should also be given to this type of system being used on mobility chairs and scooters.  Rolling walkers could also be considered.  

This system would give greater protection to people who may need to leave a nursing home for a physician’s appointment and then return.  It would also help wheelchair bound individuals in stores, office settings, etc.  

“IV pole / umbrella” devices (D) would bear some similarity to the preceding discussion on wheelchairs.  These would be more suitable for ambulatory individuals, particularly those with pre-existing conditions that may make them more susceptible to getting Covid-19.  The protective emitters could be established along the length of the pole.  It might be possible to incorporate some type of “umbrella” arrangement at the top of the pole (allowing Far UVC light to shine downward), but consideration should be given as to whether that would cause any balance problems.  The design of a system should take into account occasions where it may need to be collapsed, such as when getting into a car.  This system would allow an ambulatory person to take protection wherever he goes and, in most cases, it can be used while the person is standing or sitting.  

This device would be of tremendous help to people who work in offices or where intensive physical labor is not required.  

The final option, “lap tray” devices (E), are similar to the two immediately preceding discussions in that they would not incorporate UVC light.  “Lap tray” devices would find their best applications in restaurants, theaters / auditoriums, “over bed” tables (for patients in hospital beds); airplanes and mass transit.  The commonality in each of these settings is that the user would be seated or in bed at an incline.  Although there would be subtle design differences, depending on the setting involved, the lap trays would emit negative ions upward.  Far UVC light would at least emit upwards and could emit towards the user, depending on their preference.  If the upward point light is an annoyance to the user, the light could be angled away a bit with a “Venetian blinds” type of adaptation.  The addition of an upward pointed air curtain, from the side and distal edges of the “lap tray” could be considered (creating an encasing, three-sided wall), but the mechanics or air curtains will not be elaborated upon here.  

The components of the “lap tray” as mentioned above should provide an extra protective environment for the user.  However, various considerations need to be taken into account.  These concern whether or not the chair being used has arm rests and whether or not a table is in front of the user.  This leads to the following possibilities:  (1) A chair with armrests and no table (movie seat, airplane seat); (2) A chair with armrests and a table (some chairs in restaurants, chairs in front of desks in some offices); (3) A chair without armrests and no table (seats on buses, subways, an auditorium using collapsible chairs); and (4) A chair without armrests and a table (some chairs in restaurants, chairs in front of desks in some offices).  In situations involving #1, the “lap tray” should have adaptations on the sides which allow it to rest upon the arm rests.  In case the user crosses his leg (which causes a knee to be raised), the design should allow some degree of elevation above the level of the top of the arm rests.  It should be noted that this option would be extremely beneficial to the airline and theatre industry.  Airlines would not be able to retrofit their aircraft to have this approach as a built-in component.  In movie theaters, any emitted light may be disturbing to others, so it would be wise for theater owners have such users sit in the back.  In situations involving #2, a difficulty arises because much of the chair arm rests will end up beneath the surface of the table which the user is facing.  Here, the user could simply move close to the table and rest the “lap tray” on top of the table.  Or, the “lap tray” could remain attached the arm rests, but only at the point closest to the user.  If the “lap tray” is elevated a bit, the user would be able to move toward the table and the “lap tray” would move in tandem and end up above the table’s surface.  However, this will become a problem if the user has to use a computer at the table, or write at the table or eat at the table.  In such circumstances the “lap tray” would be in the way.  The only conceivable way to address this would be to enable the “lap tray” to be split in the middle.  The two pieces would be placed on the table, facing each other.  This would not afford the same degree of protection as when resting on arm rests, but it would help. In situations involving #3, a user could, of course, simply place the “lap tray” on their lap.  However, since a person usually shift’s their body while seated, it may be difficult to keep it perfectly situated.  At least one hand would need to hold it, constantly.  One way to address this would be to simply have a strap around the neck attach to it, at the device’s most distal points (left and right).  A foam pillow of some type, to rest under the “lap tray”, might also help a bit.  Retractable legs for the “lap tray” might be considered, but they might cause someone who passes by to trip.  In situations involving #4, they would have to be addressed in a manner as described for #2, above, namely dividing the device in half.   Note that an ambulatory person could carry a “lap tray” from one setting to another with a shoulder strap.

All of the above mentioned negative ion, UVC and Far UVC options would clean the air immensely and, of great importance, would be so visible that the public would feel more assured.  The public could continue wearing masks, but there would be less fear in these settings where any of these options presented from the beginning of this write-up to this point are seen in use.  

Since manufacturers are already making negative ion generators, UVC and Far UVC components, they do not need any encouragement in their development production of devices that already exist.  However, what is needed is a high-level request from the government to consider making the types of devices as described above.  Such a request would be magnified even further if all of the industries that have been severely affected by Covid-19 were to clamor for the production of such options.  They would know that if these systems were in place, their employees would be safer and the public would feel far safer in patronizing them. 

Unfortunately, the cost of placing any of the above systems in offices, schools, restaurants, or in the hands of patients/consumers to a degree to where they would be truly effective would be sky high.   That is where the Federal government may need to use the Defense Production Act, offer tax deductions, etc.  Mass installations and or individual unit distributions could effectively serve as a infrastructure measure.

864,Certification system for indoor settings which have implemented advanced systems to reduce the airborne and contact transmission of Covid-19,"This concept ultimately concerns a way to make indoor environments “pandemic safe”, preferably under a yet non-existent certification or “seal of approval” system.  

I will begin this presentation with a discussion of the existence of virucidal coatings in the perspective of their original intent; their application on various surfaces in the environment.  I will also be discussing the types of handles that are encountered in the environment, with a focus on their design.  Handles are the most predominant, likely-to-be-touched objects in the everyday, public environment.  Also, further below I will provide information concerning potential approaches for fighting the airborne transmission of Covid-19.  

Following the overview discussions on surfaces, handles and devices to help prevent the transmission of airborne Covid-19, I will get to the ultimate goal of this narrative:  developing a mechanism for promoting  their use within buildings and elsewhere.  It is hoped that the above-mentioned applications will become commonplace in the indoor environment.  
Although the attainment of a heavily protected environment may not be possible during our encounter with Covid-19 in 2020, we might be able to attain the goal in later years prior to the commencement of another pandemic, perhaps helping to keeping it from getting a foothold in the first place.

Let’s begin with information on virucidal surfaces.    
 
In the current situation with Covid-19, it has become difficult for people to buy hand cleansers and multiple gloves to carry along with them. Thus, when people go to work or shop and conduct other daily activities, there is a high probability that their hands will come into contact with virus laden surfaces and thus transfer the viruses to other surfaces (or themselves). 
Keeping this in mind, the reader is invited to examine the links (below) which my casual research uncovered. As you will see, they discuss the invention by various entities of coatings for use on various items (handrails, medical equipment, etc.), which can essentially kill viruses on contact, or at least within a very short period of time. Other coatings of a similar nature exist or are currently being developed.

Although I have presented a concept in another narrative proposing the development of a glove with virucidal characteristics, the eventual coating of likely touched surfaces would augment the work of any gloves.  If virucidal gloves are not developed, the coating of likely touched surfaces would still make a significant impact.

As an aside, it might not be possible to coat touch screens.  In those cases, a stylus with a virucidal coating hanging nearby would circumvent this problem.  

The key take away from the preceding is that surfaces for use in the public realm can be manufactured with virucidal properties or products can have virucidal coatings added to them.

Somewhat related to the topic of surfaces is the matter of handles.  Handles are a major item that people can be expected to touch in the public realm.  They are found everywhere, such as with the following:  building entrance and room doors; grocery store freezer / refrigerator doors; office refrigerator doors; rest room doors; drop box handles, sink handles; toilet handles; cabinet handles; and so forth.  The handles (or knobs) come in various types, as shown here:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Door_handle ; https://www.thespruce.com/select-correct-door-hardware-4125753          As stated in these links and discoverable in a basic internet search, the available types are:  lever; pull (”U” shaped); door knob (round); and handset (thumb is used).  Also used on doors are emergency push bars and flat push panels.  

Various types of add-on or stand-alone devices have been made for use on lever and pull handles to enable use without the need of a hand grasp.  Thus, there is less of a chance of contact transmission.  Examples are shown here:  https://www.dezeen.com/2020/03/25/hands-free-door-handle-coronavirus-ivo-tedbury-freddie-hong/ ; https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-52008745 ;

https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/sanitgrasp--the-public-hands-free-door-handle---is-exploding-in-sales-301026958.html

It should be noted that the add-on-devices could quite feasibly be incorporated into solid (“one piece”) designs from manufacturers.  Regarding door knobs and handsets, it does not appear that anyone has come up with an approach to make them infection-prevention-friendly.  The owners of buildings with such handles may prefer to keep them for aesthetic reasons, but be open to add-on adaptations during a pandemic.  Door knobs could probably be addressed by a rubber-coated vice-like component to encircle the knob (locked into place) and attaching a lever/armrest in a manner similar to what is shown in some of the preceding links.  Handsets could possibly be addressed with a lever positioned above the thumb receptacle which could be pulled forward with a forearm.  This movement would cause a piece of the lever to depress the thumb receptacle.  These are just rough outlines, I am certain someone could bring something like these concepts into existence.   

In view of the preceding, we have options for making a major source of contact transmission in the environment safer for users.     

Next, regarding a way to reduce the airborne transmission of Covid-19, there is the option of negative ion generators.  In a nutshell, negative ions weigh down any particulates in the air (including microorganisms) and cause them to fall to the ground.  Furthermore, there is research which indicates that negative ions can kill viruses outright.  If the negative ions from negative ion generators can indeed have these effects, they have great potential for limiting the exposure of people in buildings to any airborne Covid-19 in the area.

Thus, negative ion generators could likely have a predominant role in establishing an extremely safe public environment.

An additional approach to reduce the airborne transmission of Covid 19 involves the application of UVC light and/or Far UVC light.   Both have strong virucidal properties.   

UVC light has been used for many years to eradicate microorganisms from the air of buildings.  Units are usually installed within ductwork, or on walls at least seven feet from the ground with shielding to prevent eye damage to people nearby (this is termed “upper air irradiation”).   The wall unit lights point outward at an angle and upward, often towards a ceiling air vent.  The following describes these type of arrangements:  https://www.achrnews.com/articles/141736-how-hvac-can-help-prevent-the-spread-of-contagious-diseases  .  A problem with UVC light is that it can harm humans.

I have outlined elsewhere how UVC light can be expanded beyond the above, traditional applications within an indoors setting.  I have also written elsewhere how Far UVC light, which will not harm humans and is relatively new to the scene, could also find a wide variety of applications in an indoor environment.  

The following provides insights on UVC:    https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20200325-covid-19-the-history-of-pandemics ;    https://www.digitaltrends.com/news/can-uv-light-kill-coronavirus/ ;  https://www.rfsafe.com/207-222-nm-uvc-light-can-slow-spread-of-novel-coronavirus-covid-19/ ; https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-21058-w  .  This suggests the Far-UVC can be emitted by LED:  https://www.news.ucsb.edu/2020/019860/power-light ; https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/uvglo-the-world-s-smartest-uv-c-led-sterilizer#/ ;  

Now that we have an understanding of the tools which are available for use in indoor environments, we need to discuss how their use can be expanded.

We can begin by noting that despite their abilities, none of these approaches have been utilized to any significant extent.  The key environmental changes that have taken place thus far are the following:  (1) staff members performing consistent cleaning (i.e. shopping cart handles); (2) markings and directional indicators on floors to help with social distancing; (3) plexiglass barriers at cash registers; (4) separate entrances and exits;(5) limitations on the number of people to enter; (6) social distancing; and (7) mandatory mask wearing by entrants.  Actually, #1- #3 are the only concepts which can be seen as involving a true environmental change of some sort.  Thus, with all of the tools at our disposal, no changes of a truly environmental nature (surfaces, air) have been incorporated.  The plexiglass might qualify, but it does nothing for everyone else in line.  This all sets us up for potential failure, as in a resurgence of Covid-19.  

In order to move along in a more proactive manner, I propose that the Federal government (or individual state governments) and/or private industry come up with some guidelines or “understandings” of what would constitute an extremely safe indoor environment.  It is proposed that if specific indoor environments comply with certain parameters, they would qualify for a special seal or certification which could be publicly displayed.  This would effectively allow them to operate in a “business as usual” mode for the remainder of Covid-19’s presence, or at the outset of any future pandemic.  It would be in a public entity’s financial or public image benefit to obtain such a seal or certification.  The only caveat in such situations is that they, and non-certified entities, might be required to have building entrants (customers, vendors, employees) wear certain items to gain entry (i.e., masks, sneeze catchers, virucidal gloves, negative ion headsets, etc.).  Such requirements by government or a private entity will not have a bearing on this seal/certification program.  

I will refer from this point on to this certifying body as a “Consortium.”  It could involve either the government, a private group, or both working together.  

The Consortium would need to establish standards of what would qualify as a truly safe indoor environment.  For example, it could address:  (1) Whether or not door (or other) handles which do not require hand use are installed; (2) Whether or not virucidal coatings are applied to all likely surfaces to be touched, such as door handles, countertops (where customers wait), card readers, thermostats, light switches, gas pump handles, shopping cart handles, door surfaces from waist to chest high (particularly in rest rooms), key pads, stylus devices for signing on a screen, table tops, parts of chairs, the containers used when going through a metal detector to hold metallic items, escalator “handles”, cash registers, line barriers (velvet rope devices), bank drive-in pneumatic tube canisters, rest room sink handles, broom handles, water fountains, product scanners,  etc.; (3) Whether or not negative ion generators, UVC light, Far UVC light or negative air flow (not discussed previously), alone (excluding negative air flow) or in combination, has been established at a level of intensity, with proper spacing, which would truly clean the air; (4) Whether or not additional devices not focused upon here (i.e., plexiglass) have been installed.  

Once standards are established and an entity passes an inspection, they would be certified and obtain all the privileges, mainly public gratitude and respect, which would come with it.  Customers would be more likely to patronize such a setting and employees would have greater morale.  

Concurrent with the preceding would be a similar understanding with manufacturers of the types of items that would be used indoors, as discussed above.  Here, the actual items or products would receive a certification.

Any certified entity would be subject to surprise, unannounced visits to confirm their continuing compliance.  

Although the certification concept has focused on indoor environments and the special devices which would be used in such settings to reduce the risk of infection, a similar approach, involving only items suitable for virucidal coatings and commonly owned by individuals, could be pursued.  The primary beneficiary would be individuals, in the form of their health.  Some of the items of interest can commonly be seen brandished in indoor public settings, such as cell phones, credit cards, wallets/purses, and house/car keys.  There should be a focus on these, because these are the items which a person will bring back home from the public settings they have visited.  Then you have other things such as:  car door handles (and various parts of car interiors), home mailboxes, door handles for consumer (home) use, food holders for work lunches and so forth.  Again, such items would need to be reviewed by the Consortium before they can use a certification seal.    

Assuming that businesses, schools, stores, etc. are supportive of the concept, the matter of cost raises its head.  One would think that the negative ion generators and light systems would be the most costly.  Perhaps their manufacture and ready availability could be subsidized by the Federal government, in lieu of infrastructure spending which has often been discussed.  Or, the devices could somehow be made available at cost.  This is the aspect of the idea which presents the greatest burden.  What would help would be studies by an impartial outside entity to determine what the true cost of a protective product is and what percentage would go beyond a reasonable profit into price gouging.  It might be that the best product in one of the above-mentioned categories has a patent and, as a result, the manufacturer has an upper hand with regards to pricing.  It should be impressed upon them that the establishment of a Consortium could bring them customers at a level far beyond what they could have expected otherwise.  Perhaps that awareness could encourage them to be more open towards lower pricing.

Tax deductions for use of these devices could be considered.  Or perhaps the Defense Production Act could come into play.    

It is hoped that someone would be able to arrive at a proper solution concerning any price roadblocks.  

Although not focused upon here, consideration should be given for requiring the above-discussed preventive measures be in place before future construction permits (for new commercial buildings) or business occupancy licenses are granted.  

If a Consortium can be formed and a consensus reached on the various points as discussed above, we may start to see the gradual formation of indoor environments used by the public to acquire a considerable degree of protection from Covid-19 (if things are expedited) and any future pandemic.  This, in turn, could greatly lower the need for any future shutdowns of the economy.

With my symptoms worsening by the hour, I was desperate to understand how my asthma might be impacting the infection, but there was little specific medical advice available.

This thought is what led to the creation of Covid-19 Stories.

Now, after graduating, they have used up all their savings to pay for bootcamp classes and was hoping to get a job after they graduate but the market is no longer the same. Usually how most of these graduate get their foot in the door is by getting discovered from attending career fairs and networking events, as they don't stand a chance applying online on traditional platforms.

853,#STOPTHEVIRUS,"It’s Spring 2020 and Coachella, SXSW, the NBA, NHL, MLB and the Tokyo Olympics are cancelled this year. We’re at the height of human technology and innovation, but at the same time facing one of the most devastating viral pandemics in history. The economy is suffering, countries around the world are facing mandatory lockdown orders and hospitals are overwhelmed. Despite this, many people are still unaware of the seriousness of COVID-19 and actions they can take to support our health care professionals such as social distancing to flatten the health care demand curve. Reducing the doubling rate of COVID-19 by even a few days can have massive impact. Can we use a high stakes social game to help inspire the youth to stop the virus?

This social game was inspired by the TV show Survivor (Watch before reading more). It's a game based on fun challenges, alliances and human psychology. The twist here is that instead of being stranded on a deserted island for 30 days, players are ""stranded"" inside their homes. This is important because social distancing, i.e. staying home, is the best tool that the youth have right now for collectively fighting the epidemic. All challenges in this game are designed to incentivize social distancing and spreading awareness. Simple activities like making home made cotton based masks can help reduce droplet based transmission rates by up to 70% and can be turned into social awareness challenges. Young and healthy people are at risk and can engage in activities that can increase risk for others, so the goal is to create home-based activities that reward risk mitigation.

Also, since the game is digital and based on social media, we aren't limited to the standard 20 players. Everyone can play. With the hope of attracting even more players and convincing them to socially distance, a donation is required to join and the winner takes all.","Official Contributors: Bernard Baker, David Zeifman, DL Warfield, Daniel Francois, Edward Alcide, Brandon Tory.","1) The MVP

862,CMV vaccine,"If a person has contracted Covid-19, it would be ideal if a person’s body could fight it off and not progress to a severe illness.  The body relies heavily on the thymus in this regard.  

The thymus has a major role in the immune system.  However, as a person ages, it gradually decreases in size, contributing to the difficulty which older people have in fighting off infections.  Furthermore, its status of a defender against infections is significantly impaired if a person had contracted CMV (Cytomegalovirus) at some point during their life.  Unfortunately, the majority of the population fits into that boat.  

The following links discuss the tremendous damage which CMV does to the thymus and how, as a result, the body’s defense against infections, (which would logically include  Covid-19), is significantly weakened.  
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2752092/

https://www.omicsonline.org/widespread-outbreaks-of-a-subtle-condition-leading-to-hospitalisation-and-death-2161-1165.1000137.php?aid=20306
And a contrarian article:  https://www.fightaging.org/archives/2018/07/arguing-that-cytomegalovirus-is-beneficial-for-old-immune-systems/

The instinctive action to take with CMV is to develop a vaccine against it.  Such efforts are in the works, but nothing has been finalized yet.  See the following:   https://thenativeantigencompany.com/where-are-we-at-with-cmv-vaccine-development/ ; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X18302883 ;   https://investors.modernatx.com/news-releases/news-release-details/moderna-completes-enrollment-cytomegalovirus-cmv-vaccine-mrna ; https://www.contagionlive.com/news/cytomegalovirus-vaccine-candidate-found-to-be-safe-and-immunogenic-in-first-in-humans-trial ; https://themedicinemaker.com/discovery-development/the-bumpy-road-to-a-cytomegalovirus-vaccine 

If a CMV vaccine came on the market today, it would not make much of an impact on Covid-19 in 2020.  But the sooner one is developed, the sooner people in the future will be able to obtain protection and, as a result, maintain their thymus function at a higher level than would a person who had become infected at some point.   Therefore, when the next pandemic comes around, a larger number of people in the general population will have significantly stronger immune systems to fight off an infection if they had the opportunity to receive a CMV vaccine..

In light of the strong, indirect effect which a CMV vaccine would have in future pandemics, I propose the following:  (1) Research whether or not there are other infectious organisms which can cause the degree of damage which CMV does and if any, its degree of prevalence in the population; (2) Conduct labwork on current hospitalized Covid-19 patients with respect to their CMV (or other organism) status; (3) Have the Federal government devote a significant amount of resources toward a vaccine against CMV; (4)  Once a vaccine is available, perform an intense campaign for people to get vaccinated.

Again, this will not have any current effect against Covid-19, but it should pay us back in the next pandemic with fewer severe cases.

Drawing on others' experiences and help, these covid-19 patients at home can effectively mitigate their anxiety and difficulties, without burdening the already overloaded public health system. Furthermore, with large enough number of self-reporting data points, a real-time map showing infection of the local community and where help is needed can be generated. 14days.me will become a platform enabling every community to stand together to help infected patients staying at home and combat Covid-19.

781,Survey: COVID19 & the STEM Community,"Considering the emergence and spread of the new respiratory Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), it is inevitable that COVID-19 will impact the lives of students and professionals. In this study, we are interested in learning about the ways in which COVID-19 has impacted science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) students and professionals personally, academically, and/or professionally. The results will be used to inform higher education and scientific institutions about these experiences, and contribute to efforts to offer support where it’s most needed.

We hypothesize that certain messaging will be perceived as helpful/unhelpful to people, based on their circumstances (e.g., geographic location, type of work) and goals (e.g., entering graduate school). In the event that certain messaging is interpreted to be helpful/unhelpful, this information will be useful moving forward during this pandemic and in the face of future crises. The higher education and STEM communities can use the findings from this study to better understand how individuals perceive the ways in which their academic/professional work is (or could be) impacted by COVID-19. Additionally, this study will explore the ways in which individuals tap into the knowledge they’ve gained as members of certain cultural/community groups during the COVID-19 crisis.

351,"COVIDx - Crowdsourcing wearables, citizen reports, & testing data to crush the COVID-19 curve","Our objective is to lower COVID-19’s Rₒ to < 0.5 by 2021. We aim to achieve this with three core developments:

<b>1. Crowdsourcing wearable data & self-reported symptom checks</b>

Studies show that resting heart rate data & sleep quality measured from wearables like Fitbits and Apple Watches can predict influenza-like illnesses at the state level. We're extending these studies to detect COVID-19 before people exhibit symptoms.

Along with passive, synchronous, and physiological data analysis, we're crowdsourcing self-reported symptom checks. Daily check-ins can help understand where the virus might be spreading and give us opportunities to intervene. Our aim is to use the power of the crowd for the rapid scaling of public health surveillance.

<b>2. Coordinating the crowdsourced data with public health agencies, hospitals, & testing facilities</b>

Hospitals & testing facilities do not have the infrastructure for managing the scale of testing we need at the local, state, & regional levels. Our aim is to leverage longitudinal data from self-reports & wearable data to help hospitals better screen for COVID-19 while supporting at-risk populations with information they need for testing.

<b>3. Gamifying self-reporting, isolation, & social distancing protocols</b>

Games are a powerful tool to promote awareness and behavioral changes, including public health. We’re applying behavioral economics & gamification techniques to scale epidemiological surveillance through volunteered contributions. Our aim is to promote awareness and behavioral changes needed to fight COVID-19.

The core of Corona-Bio is “citizen-science” and the advantages crowdsourcing has when meeting challenges like the covid-19 pandemic. Patients with confirmed diagnoses can record their symptoms daily, along with several health-related factors, diet, and enviromental data. Corona-Bio utilizes HL7, Open – EHR protocols, methodology and technology. Corona-Bio’s main purpose is to aid the development of new healthcare strategies to combat the coronavirus pandemic and to improve person-centered care, by recording as many cases as possible, including non-hospitalized and discharged patients who are positive for the virus with mild, moderate or no symptoms. Self-reported data from patients, and their disease progression, will aid in better understanding the variable clinical cases, their etiology and the unique disease progression of some groups of individuals from different demographic areas. 
All patient information collected on the Corona-Bio platform is offered for free to public health organizations, institutions or public health authorities dealing with Covid-19. The data will be used only for research purposes, with all required security protocols, for as long as needed.  Additionally, users can observe the data analysis process related to the clinical course of the Covid-19. 
We hope that our platform can help the broader effort in making pandemic information more appropriate and available for the health care systems as well as facing more effectively present or future challenges.

821,Arnuv Tandon,"RemoteTA is an online volunteering platform allowing high school students to remotely volunteer with elementary school teachers and help teachers create the digital resources needed to teach online during COVID-19 school closures. Essentially, students act as “remote teacher’s assistants”, helping teachers complete various online projects.

The beauty of this platform is that a majority of the tasks teachers now need to complete due to remote learning - converting lesson plans into online games, digital worksheets, and other engaging formats - are all tasks that are second nature to high school students.

RemoteTA’s volunteering process is best explained by an example. Let’s imagine a scenario where we have an elementary school teacher Mrs.Harris and a high school student Kevin.

Mrs.Harris had a wonderful in-person game planned, intended to engage her students and get them excited about learning world history. In light of COVID-19 school closures, this is no longer a possibility. She has the idea of making an online game, however, she is not sure how to do this and knows it would take hours to implement her curriculum into the game. Now, she has a difficult decision. Does she scrap the idea for the game and do a standard lesson with her students, or does she spend her valuable time and energy making the game?

With RemoteTA, Mrs.Harris does not have to make this decision. She can get the online game she wants while spending a fraction of the time and energy it would take to make the game herself.

She accomplishes this in 5 easy steps.

1) Mrs.Harris creates an account on remoteta.org (a fully functional website)

2) Mrs.Harris briefly describes her project, specifies a deadline, and posts it on the website. It is now visible to thousands of high school students

3) Kevin sees the project and is intrigued. He loves making games and giving back to the community. Consequently, he signs up.

4) Now, Mrs.Harris communicates with Kevin over email to ensure he has everything he needs to complete the project. In this case, Mrs.Harris would likely specify what type of game she wants, how many questions it should have, and the curriculum for her history unit. Kevin can also email Mrs.Harris any questions he has along the way.

5) Kevin works to complete the project by the deadline and then submits it via the website. Now, Kevin has earned volunteer hours and is happy to have helped the community. Mrs.Harris has spent a minimal amount of time and is now able to engage her students with an online game. It is truly a win-win situation","Currently my leadership team is comprised of a President, Head of Technology, and Head of Outreach.

660,Charu Sukhlecha,"Goal-
-Increasing access to quality healthcare for every patient in need, no matter the setting or the location, 
-Reducing the chances of healthcare workers getting infected while treating covid 19 positive patients.
-To train the manpower especially nursing and allied staff to be prepared to counter the pandemic in times of need.


Current challenges in critical care-
-Covid 19 pandemic.
-chances of infections to healthcare workers in contact with Covid positive patients.
-Number of patients needing critical care are increasing 
– Ageing population and increasing life expectancy 
– Increasing healthcare expectations 
- Financial burden and decreasing ability to pay 
– Availability of skilled manpower availability especially doctors, nurses, pharmacists and others in rural indian sector.
- Critical care patients need specialized care takers with high competence level 
– Critical care is a human resource intensive therapy (P/N 1:1) 
– Need for remote monitoring techniques to identify those at risk earlier

Patient outcomes and treatment costs depend on 
• Dedicated 24/7 intensivist and ICU nursing staff 
• Volume of the case flow necessitating regionalized or centralized care 
• Skilled interdisciplinary teamwork (incl. eg. pharmacists, physiotherapists) 
• Compliance to evidence based treatment protocols 
• Rapid identification of the at risk patient with prompt initiation of treatment also outside the ICU (e.g. Medical Emergency Teams) 
• Patient management after the ICU stay (e.g. ICU outreach teams)


How could telemedicine help? 
- Improve quality of care and increase productivity of intensivists and ICU nurses – Maximize resources and expertise for larger regional critical care patient population – Immediate access to experienced ICU nurse or intensivists 
– Allow remote monitoring, advice and support of bed side caretakers (intensivists and nurses) between units and hospitals 
– Regional coordination and guidance of treatment processes 
– Provide real-time education (via camera) 
-Provide earlier identification of patients at risk and treatment initiation in all areas of the hospital 
- Interaction with patients and families and local caretakers during crisis and difficult discussions 
- Check for compliance with best practices 
- Provide tools for quality improvement by gathering information for benchmarking and best practices 
- Provide tools for national and international collaboration 


Telemedicine utilization in CAV Global Solutions ICU

ICU multidiciplinary morning rounds through remote monitoring: 
– Doctors, nurses and pharmacists are gathered to ”command center” where they analyze patient data, discuss the cases and make treatment plan 
– No bedside walking rounds 
– Real-time patient data is projected to big screen for all participants to review -
 electronic medical records • laboratory results • physiological parameters (incl. real time ECG and EEG) • critical care information system • medication • imaging data • nursing notes 

Tele-consultation 
- To a remote central hospital when needed 
- similar patient data management systems between hospitals 
– Interactive telemedicine solution provides all relevant information for the consulting intensivist ◊ better support for colleagues and information for better decisions 
– Multi-disciplinary university hospital level support available in a single session 
– Fewer patient transfers needed between hospitals

Manpower training-We have a dedicated curriculum designed especially for nursing and pharmacist staff pertaining to critical care medicine.


Telemedicine improves ICU outcomes; 
a meta-analysis 
• 15667 pre-intervention and 25797 post-intervention patients 
• Statistically significant 20 % decrease in ICU mortality (OR 0.8, CI 0.66-0.97, p=0.02) 
• Decrease in hospital mortality (OR 0.82, CI 0.65- 1.03, p=0.08) 
• Statistically significant decrease in the ICU length of stay (mean difference 1.26 days; CI -2.2—0.3, p=0.01) 
• Decrease in the length of hospital stay (mean difference 0.64 days; CI -1.52-0.25, p=.16)

623,Simulator for the spread of COVID19 disease within refugee camps,"Refugee camps usually have a very high population density which makes them vulnerable to the spread of the pandemic. Within these camps, vulnerable groups extend beyond the old population and there are people with conditions like TB, HIV, malnutrition which expose them at a higher risk to the virus. Due to the lack of quarantine facilities in these camps, the virus left uncurbed will spread very quickly since young people and old people have regular interactions. There are already a relatively small number of medical staff working in the camps, lack of medical supply due to less attention paid to the refugee camps can mean that the medical staff are at a greater risk of getting infected.

705,Mia – voluntary journal-contact-tracing,"Test-Isolate-Quarantine, or variations thereof, appears to be the right method to return to life as usual and reanimate the economy, while keeping the spread of SARS-CoV-2 under control.

Traditional and investigative contact tracing methods require much manpower and bring forth damaging delays.

While imposed automatic location tracking may be seen as an effective approach, Switzerland’s liberal ecosystem prevents the state from overstepping on individuals’ privacy. Following each citizen’s footsteps using location data to manage quarantine policies, although effective, would violate that concept.

To address that issue, apps applying proximity detection to track encounters are gaining widespread attention. Their high adoption and precision requirements present quite the challenge.

We see a need to digitalize the process of manual contact tracing. Mia suggests an alternative based on human recollection, that protects privacy, and creates an impact from the first user onwards.","In our primary work life we are two web designers, one web developer, one product manager, one epidemiologist, one data scientist and one statistician",get in contact with health institutions and get support,2020-04-14 05:38:24.904000-07:00,2020-04-14 05:38:24.904000-07:00,Switzerland,hi.appmia@gmail.com,False,"we are at a point where we need confirmation from authorities and and health institutions, to know if our voluntary journal-contact-tracing app is viable","https://appmia.ch/#/

One theme will likely be noise pollution, i.e. how the current lack of noise shows how noisy we usually are and create better awareness of the impact humans have on the planet.

Why is this important? It's because we live in the so-called Anthropocene, the first geological epoch in the history of this planet that's dominated by the effects of the activity of just one species: Humans. Many aspects of the Anthropocene have been discussed and reported on, among them plastic pollution and climate change. But very few projects focus on what the human presence on this planet means for its soundscapes.

There are two ways to help. Let us know which you prefer, if either:

1. Lensmaking: Can you please download lensstudio.snapchat.com and confirm that you're interested in a) using this creative suite, and b) making lenses around COVID-19?
2. Marketing: We can always use help from savvy social media marketers in getting our lenses distributed smartly on Snap and Insta. If you think you can help, especially with influencer marketing, let me know.

537,Patient chat: Local Peer-to-Peer Video Chat for Biosecurity Medical Contexts,"Phone-to-phone video chat without Internet or a Local Area Network needed.

A single-purpose application allowing high-quality audio and video chat between two nearby mobile devices without external networking. Essentially turning two phones into a pair of video-enabled ""walkie-talkies"", connected to one another by Wi-Fi signals without any other network or devices involved. 

Intended for use where biosecurity makes direct contact difficult and unsafe, allowing easier communication with patients inside biosecurity zones. 

Primary use-case (based on requests from medics) is a COVID-19 medic checking in frequently with a patient in an isolation room without physically visiting each time.

Medics can use it to interact more frequently with their patients while conserving PPE and minimizing exposure risk. Families can use it to interact with loved ones that cannot be safely visited in person. Works like a baby monitor, but deployed on any mobile device without additional hardware.

861,Thymus regeneration,"If a person has contracted Covid-19, it would be ideal if a person’s body could fight it off and not progress to a severe illness.  There can be a number of factors that may help or hinder the body in vanquishing it quickly, among them:  genetics; the presence or absence of other illnesses (i.e., diabetes, heart disease, etc.); whether or not a vaccine had been previously injected; and age.  Genetics can’t be changed, co-existing illnesses will not disappear overnight; a vaccine is not here yet; and age cannot be reversed …. or can it?

The thymus has a major role in the immune system and fighting off infections.  However, as a person ages, it gradually decreases in size, contributing to the difficulty which older people have in fighting off infections.  If it had remained at greater strength over the decades, elderly people would fare well.  Since Covid-19 hits elderly people quite hard, it makes one wonder how it would be if the elderly had retained a healthy thymus.  We may have an answer to this in the coming years.  

In noting the importance of the thymus in fighting off infections, it is interesting to find that a number of scientists are already making progress towards the goal of actually regenerating the thymus, as the following links reveal:
https://www.the-scientist.com/daily-news/researchers-develop-a-technique-to-regenerate-the-mouse-thymus-30421
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4837659/
https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12015-020-09955-y
https://www.researchgate.net/publication/338908647_Thymus_Regeneration_and_Future_Challenges
https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-02638-w 

Obviously, it is very unlikely that a fully tested and approved method of thymus regeneration will become available in 2020 or even the following year.  If, by some miracle, an approved method was on hand, it could be of tremendous benefit in protecting the elderly who had not yet been infected.  

Of course, the hunt for a vaccine or outright cure will be everyone’s focus while Covid-19 remains a threat.  But we should start giving serious thought to devoting a large proportion of resources to thymus regeneration, to be prepared for the next time a pandemic takes place.  Although no one can predict when that will be, know this:  America’s enemies have seen what Covid-19 has done to our economy and cannot be excluded from considering the surreptitious launch of an “accident” along these lines in the future.  Should thymus regeneration already be perfected, our chances of weathering another pandemic will be dramatically improved.  

I therefore urge that consideration be given to having the Federal government place a major focus of funding thymus regeneration research and accelerating its path to implementation. 

In addition, I would urge that studies commence now with hospitalized Covid-19 patients to evaluate their thymus function and compare it to the degree of their recovery.  The findings will likely boost the case for devoting a significant amount of resources to thymus regeneration.
