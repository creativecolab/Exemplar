      "description":"RemoteTA is an online volunteering platform allowing high school students to remotely volunteer with elementary school teachers and help teachers create the digital resources needed to teach online during COVID-19 school closures. Essentially, students act as “remote teacher’s assistants”, helping teachers complete various online projects.\r\n\r\nThe beauty of this platform is that a majority of the tasks teachers now need to complete due to remote learning - converting lesson plans into online games, digital worksheets, and other engaging formats - are all tasks that are second nature to high school students.\r\n\r\nRemoteTA’s volunteering process is best explained by an example. Let’s imagine a scenario where we have an elementary school teacher Mrs.Harris and a high school student Kevin.\r\n\r\nMrs.Harris had a wonderful in-person game planned, intended to engage her students and get them excited about learning world history. In light of COVID-19 school closures, this is no longer a possibility. She has the idea of making an online game, however, she is not sure how to do this and knows it would take hours to implement her curriculum into the game. Now, she has a difficult decision. Does she scrap the idea for the game and do a standard lesson with her students, or does she spend her valuable time and energy making the game?\r\n\r\nWith RemoteTA, Mrs.Harris does not have to make this decision. She can get the online game she wants while spending a fraction of the time and energy it would take to make the game herself.\r\n\r\nShe accomplishes this in 5 easy steps.\r\n\r\n1) Mrs.Harris creates an account on remoteta.org (a fully functional website)\r\n\r\n2) Mrs.Harris briefly describes her project, specifies a deadline, and posts it on the website. It is now visible to thousands of high school students\r\n\r\n3) Kevin sees the project and is intrigued. He loves making games and giving back to the community. Consequently, he signs up.\r\n\r\n4) Now, Mrs.Harris communicates with Kevin over email to ensure he has everything he needs to complete the project. In this case, Mrs.Harris would likely specify what type of game she wants, how many questions it should have, and the curriculum for her history unit. Kevin can also email Mrs.Harris any questions he has along the way.\r\n\r\n5) Kevin works to complete the project by the deadline and then submits it via the website. Now, Kevin has earned volunteer hours and is happy to have helped the community. Mrs.Harris has spent a minimal amount of time and is now able to engage her students with an online game. It is truly a win-win situation",

This results in possible transmission or infection of COVID-19, and an increase of doctor visits straining the medical resources available. \r\n\r\nSolution:\r\nPrognosis, diagnosis and screening for the patients infected with COVID-19 is suggested to be based on breathing characteristics (Wang et al. 2020. https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.05534) as well as other vital signs such as blood oxygen saturation/hemoglobin levels (https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/03/200330152135.htm). \r\nThe detection of vital signs can be achieved via facial cameras and machine learning for breathing patterns (Chen et al. 2019 https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.03503.pdf), hemoglobin levels (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6371334/), HRV and others (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6396075/). \r\n\r\nThe proposed project is an app that can be installed and used on any smartphone and laptop to detect early symptoms of COVID-19 remotely without leaving the home. As well as for monitoring (ongoing interest from healthcare and medical institutions already). \r\nIt uses the detection of vital signs and breathing characteristics via technological devices accessible to everybody at home with cameras of smartphones/laptop and machine learning, and combines it with the detection of pearly symptoms. \r\nThe app user will also be able to use therapeutic exercises such as aerobic, mindfulness and belly breathing (https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/20/style/self-care/isolation-exercise-meditation-coronavirus.html). Often, many exercises require additional app use, and are therefore not accessible and as widely used among elderly, vulnerable and people in under-resourced communities. The app will enable an inclusive and accessible use, in combination with vital sign detection. So for the therapeutic part of the app, the vital sign provides a measurement of progress, for instance by showing a reduction of average heart rate, improvement of hemoglobin levels or deeper breathing patterns. Vital signs can offer a quantification of stress levels and progress of health for motivation, too. \r\n\r\nThe app can also include information on resources to reach for the nearest hospital, doctor and pharmacy. \r\nAs well as resources for communal support and connection to nearest online groups, help for grocery delivery etc. ",

Unfortunately what’s also starting to turn normal is the fear and anxiety that many people experience dealing with these situations that we’re now facing every single day.\r\n\r\nThe sad truth is, we have this rather large population of people who are much more susceptible to COVID-19 and the risk to them if they contract it is life threatening. Asthmatics, people with immune disorders, the elderly and even just people who are just badly out of shape. \r\n\r\nFor this large but limited set of the global population, doing simple things that we all take for granted like getting groceries or getting the mail is now much more dangerous. On top of that, many people may not be fortunate enough to have others to rely on so they have no other choice but to take the risk in order to survive... Imagine that… Risking your life so you can get groceries.\r\n\r\nThat’s a situation that I don’t think anyone should ever have to be put in. That is the problem that we’re solving with CheckUpOn.me.\r\n\r\nCheckUpOn.Me provides a peer-to-peer message and outreach platform for creating connections between volunteers, public safety professionals and people in need. During the COVID-19 pandemic our goal is to help where it's needed most by connecting people in need with volunteers and professionals who will be ready to take action. \r\n\r\nOur solution is built on top of the Open Source React and NodeJS project called Spoke. Spoke is an application that facilitates texting between end users and volunteers and is most well known for being used by grassroots political campaigns in the USA such as the Bernie Sanders Campaign and Elizabeth Warren Campaign for facilitating voter outreach.\r\n\r\nCheckUpOn.Me is part of the Reach4Help.org family. There are a large number of organizations struggling with certain logistics, such as coordinating their volunteer workforce, prioritizing the most urgent requests, and ensuring that all requests get fulfilled. Reach4Help.org is an open project that aims to address these issues, by enabling those in need to receive help and enabling partner groups and organizations to help more efficiently by mobilizing their volunteers with the help of Reach4Helps relief management platform. \r\n\r\n--- Where can I learn more?\r\n\r\nYou can learn more about CheckUpOn.Me here: https://github.com/checkuponme/info.\r\n\r\nYou can learn more about Reach4Help here: https://github.com/reach4help/reach4help.\r\n\r\n--- What's next for CheckUpOn.Me\r\n\r\nWhile our current goal is to support the fight against COVID-19, our end goal is to help enable virtual civic collaboration for creating the cure for significant systemic risks to which adequate public and private solutions don't exist by rapidly creating and spreading a global, community driven, open source solution. \r\n\r\n--- In closing...\r\n\r\nI want to thank everyone for participating in all of these recent COVID-19 relief focused hackathons and maker festivals. It’s truly been a moving experience in some really dark times.",

Unlike the recently laid off, most of them could not apply for unemployment benefit as they were not previously working fulltime and they were focusing on the rigorous bootcamp. Now, after graduating, they have used up all their savings to pay for bootcamp classes and was hoping to get a job after they graduate but the market is no longer the same. Usually how most of these graduate get their foot in the door is by getting discovered from attending career fairs and networking events, as they don't stand a chance applying online on traditional platforms. Without Covid it was already hard enough for them to get discovered and noticed compared to a 4yr degree program graduate. And now with in-person networking events and career fair gone due to Covid-19, its near impossible for them to get the visibility they need towards a job. We are creating a platform specially to help them get discovered by companies. Already talked to many people, companies and bootcamps, it is a real problem without a solution at the moment.

The site also includes a community resource guide so folks can look up essential services and resources in their area.   Although the site is not meant as a source for news, links to COVID-19 updates are included, including to the WHO, CDC, State, County, and City sites. ",
      "docs_and_demo":"WHAT WE ARE DOING\r\nWe are engineering a platform to enable non-technically oriented volunteers to easily deploy an application to their local community, whether that be a neighborhood, town, city, country, or other municipality. Community managers will have access to a Content Management System, pre-loaded with globally-relevant resources which can be localized for community-specific needs.\r\n\r\nWHY THIS IS NEEDED\r\nWith countless at risk citizens forced to enter harm’s way to acquire necessities and communities ineffectively scrambling to cobble together resources and ways to support one-another, there is an absolute need for a more efficient and effective solution. The best organized communities are relying on email newsletters and convoluted Google Sheets to sign up to support one another. By creating a simple-to-use Content Management System with preloaded, customizable resources, communities will have a complete solution at their fingertips in minutes.\r\n\r\nIn our pilot community in Battle Creek, Michigan, we rolled out the alpha COVID-19 Response Network, which was immediately adopted by The SHARE Center, a local non profit that feeds the homeless, and received 20 volunteer sign ups within 14 days of its launch, as well as 11 offers of help that are organized by a community manager. Based on the initial usage, our team has been actively working to continuously improve the product and add additional features. Given that this is a marathon and not a sprint, we are building this to be a full-featured solution, accessible on a variety of platforms\r\n\r\nHOW WE WILL GROW\r\nThe vision for Networked.Community began with the fight against COVID-19, however we quickly came to appreciate our localizable community activism engine has use cases far beyond the present epidemic. COVID-19 is an important catalyst and immediate threat which requires a globally coordinated effort. It is also the canary in a coalmine for significant underlying societal risks for which there are not currently any viable solutions.\r\n\r\nThe fact that a virus could immediately have such a dramatic negative impact highlights much greater systemic risks. Unfortunately, we understand that relying on government and corporate institutions to solve these problems is not a viable solution, now or in the future. Society as it exists has unintelligently evolved in a manner that is not rewarded for proactively addressing problems such as COVID-19. A society built on quarterly cycles and profit above all else will never prioritize investing in safety nets so desperately needed.\r\n\r\nThe long-lasting ramifications of COVID-19 are significant. Prior to this epidemic, society was already set on a collision course for the unplanned negative side effects of automation, robotics and intelligent computing; this epidemic will only hasten their arrival. Similarly, adequate solutions do not currently exist to request and provide support and resources to one another, nor does the technical infrastructure to deliver and trade goods. Finally, neither a basic income nor a solution for virtual employment is available for those displaced from the livelihood today and tomorrow.\r\n\r\nWe have an opportunity for technology to lead to a utopian future in which humanity is connected and collaborating for the greater good. Unfortunately, history has continually proven that it is more efficient to work against, instead of with, one another. However, we have the tools and willpower to shift this paradigm.\r\n\r\nIn addition to engineering the platform, we are actively partnering with complementary initiatives not to reinvent the wheel, but to make an automobile. There is no need to have a monopoly on doing good, so we will continually seek any opportunities to increase the impact of complementary initiatives. As we grow, our success will scale along with our technology partners and their own communities.\r\n\r\nThe ability to request and provide services to those within our local communities is an ever present need. By focusing on the long-term vision and a broader mission while actively addressing the current epidemic, we are creating a solution that will be immeasurable today and into the future.\r\n\r\nENSURING QUALITY OF CONTENT\r\nWikipedia was once widely considered a non-reliable information source, however it is now one of the most frequently used sources globally for people to find information on nearly any topic. The reason Wikipedia is so successful is because of its vast and loyal volunteer community working tirelessly to ensure the most accurate and up-to-date information. We plan to take the same approach for our Networked.Community.\r\n\r\nWe have already implemented a rigorous volunteer vetting process as modeled and shared by the Progressive Coders Network. As we continue to grow and evolve we will combine technical solutions with human intervention to ensure that those contributed directly to the central platform as well as the volunteers helping their local communities meet the highest possible standards.\r\n\r\nCHALLENGES\r\nThe most significant challenge at this time is finding volunteers with the availability to contribute, from developers to organizers and strategists and beyond. We are working on building much more than a website...we are building a movement with the potential to change how humanity operates. And such a movement requires significant time, energy and resources.\r\n\r\nAs we are in our new and immature state, we need people capable of navigating uncertainty and helping to define and build the future. Right now, we are mostly a blank canvas with a noble goal. As visibility to our mission and vision spreads, we will increase the variety and ease of which volunteers may become involved.\r\n\r\nTo volunteer, please fill out our intake form. https://thecure.to/Selfishness\r\n\r\nSpecial thanks to\r\nStephen Scapelliti of the Progressive Coders Network for helping advise on different legal and organizational processes.",

      "description":"We are in the process of accumulating large amounts of data and resources to support larger demographies in the past few weeks and months. But how long these folks in rural and mountain communities need to wait for us? \r\n\r\nThe challenge goal: Data-driven project coordination and policymaking\r\nIn this six-month PWG, Omdena AI challenge with Fruitpunch AI, we aim to help rural and mountain community governments and policymakers to make data-driven decisions in order to deal with pandemics and cover some of the following topics. \r\n\r\nWhen travel is restricted, schools closed, events cancelled, and communities put into quarantine, individuals and businesses in those ecosystems lose their source of income. How does that loss of income impact the health and financial stability of those individuals? What resources are in place currently that supports their needs and growing demands in areas of health, and food security.\r\n\r\nWhat we will build\r\nLeveraging the power of global collaboration, the goal is to build AI models that reveal the effects of specific programs and policy decisions being made by governments and institutions on the economically marginalized, especially working in the informal sector.\r\n\r\nIn this way, institutions can identify the most effective ways to deal with future pandemics to minimize economic impact and human deaths not only in the short term but also in the midterm.\r\n\r\nWhy you should join the challenge\r\nFor the next six months, you will not only build AI solutions to make a real-world impact but also go through an entire data science project lifecycle. This covers problem scoping, data collection and preparation, as well as modelling for potential deployment.\r\n\r\nAnd the best part is that you will be part of a global collaboration.\r\n\r\nBackground Context: \r\nMountain region and smaller communities in rural and small urban areas are more vulnerable now more than ever. This project will be conducted to understand and draw attention to alarming facts of the rural, small urban, and mountain communities during this epidemic pandemic #covid9 outbreak: as many of us are aware in 2012, 39 per cent of the mountain population in developing countries was considered vulnerable to food insecurity, which is an increase of 30% compared to the conditions of mountain peoples in the year 2000 studies. \r\n\r\nThe situation is even worse if we consider only rural mountain peoples.\r\nThe living conditions of mountain peoples have deteriorated and their vulnerability to hunger has increased. Harsh climates and the difficult, often inaccessible terrain, combined with political and social marginality certainly contribute to making mountain peoples particularly vulnerable to food shortages.\r\n\r\nIn mountain areas, where family farming and smallholder agriculture, forestry and animal husbandry are the prevailing farming systems, it is essential to create a supportive, enabling environment in which mountain peoples have access to training, information, credit and healthcare, and benefit from reliable governance systems and infrastructure. \r\n\r\nSome Established Stats:\r\nMountains cover 22 per cent of the world’s land surface and are home to some 915 million people, representing 13 per cent of the global population. Mountains also provide between 60 and 80 per cent of the earth’s freshwater. Yet, in spite of this global relevance, there is a dearth of data and information on the status of mountains and mountain peoples. \r\n\r\nCan we understand what is it to live in the mountain regions and smaller communities during these testing times? Can we understand more about these folks who are waiting for someone to appear and help them with tools and resources to keep themselves and their communities safe? \r\n\r\nIn 2003, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) published “Towards a GIS-based analysis of mountain environments and populations”, a study that estimated mountain peoples’  vulnerability to food insecurity. What about Health, and Safety? \r\n\r\nThe studies in the past were undertaken as a follow-up to the 2002 UN International Year of Mountains, has become a cornerstone of development efforts. It is used and quoted, for as a reference, requesting more investments, specific policies and global attention toward mountains. \r\n\r\nBut how much do we know about these communities in these times? What can we do about it? How best can we equip them with resources and tools to protect themselves and their loved ones? We understand and see all countries have locked themselves in, what about these unfortunate folks who relied on larger players and the larger coalition of countries to help them? Can we spare some time and resources to work on these matters? \r\n\r\nWe all love going to these mountains, smaller communities for several reasons and now they need us. \r\n\r\nI am the Founder of Project Work Groups - focussed to research and develop sustainable solutions in the mountain and rural regions globally.  Proworkgroups.com is our webpage. \r\nMy Twitter Handle: @tekiuday",

It operates on anonymized crowdsourced data.\r\n\r\nCoCo consists of 2 parts: the CoCoMed app and infomed.live\r\nThe CoCoMed app is designed to overcome the primary problem of contact tracing apps, that both users need to have the app. Bluetooth based contact tracing needs around 60% of the local population to adopt the app for viability. We believe this threshold is untenable. We are using GPS data to overcome this threshold. The combination is used to prospectively identify vulnerable zones where infection can spread fast. This data can be used to direct testing/fumigation efforts in an informed manner. This platform is also well suited to large-scale clinical research. We collect basic health and medication data. This is used to identify co-morbidities and drug interactions on a large scale from identified cases. A symptom tracker is included for primary screening, following which where is an option to schedule tests and self-report in a verified manner. CoCoMed is a privacy-first app. We are using the TCN protocol for bluetooth and have developed an algorithm for private and secure GPS data transfer. Details can be found on our github page(readme).\r\n\r\nInfomed.live connects hospitals and health authorities. Hospitals update their inventory, patient load, personnel status, etc on the platform for authorities to view. Infomed also integrates with the CoCoMed app to help users schedule tests with hospitals and testing centers. We aim this towards reducing overcrowding at hospitals and reducing the risk of spread. This mechanism also helps verify self-reported cases, an important feedback feature.\r\n\r\nJOIN US https://join.slack.com/t/cocomed/shared_invite/zt-dvj02rki-Vw_I7ezE8_Ho8uAwGBdc3w",

      "description":"Verboden Labs is helping hospitals and heath care clinics access highly reliable and cost-effective COVID-19 Antibody Detection Tests to test as many front line workers as possible. A test for antibodies that produces results within 15 minutes especially in people that didn't even know they had it, is a crucial part of the public health strategy and its impact could be enormous.\r\n\r\nWe need your help with the following tasks:\r\n\r\n1. App developers to create an app that interprets test results\r\n2. Identify and reach out to hospitals and medical clinics\r\n3. Create infographics for social media posts and email campaigns\r\n\r\nABOUT THE TEST\r\n\r\nThe SARS-CoV-2 IgM/IgG Antibody Rapid Test is an in-vitro diagnostic immunochromatographic assay used in the detection of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies (IgM and IgG) in whole blood or serum from individuals who are suspected of COVID-19 infection but display little to no symptoms. With only two drops of blood from the fingertip, the test can determine the presence of immunoglobulins IgM and IgG, which are found in the blood of people who have been exposed to the SARS-CoV-2 virus. With clear results in 15 minutes, healthcare professionals can make a quick, reliable diagnosis without the need for a laboratory. Precious time will be saved that will help contain the further spread of the virus. This test is most accurate in detecting antibody levels in patients after at least 14 days after the onset of symptoms.\r\n\r\nHOW IT WORKS\r\n\r\nWhen the body is exposed to a virus, the immune system begins to produce antibodies to fight the virus and future infections from it. Those antibodies remain behind after the virus is cleared from the body, which the tests detect. This confirms a previous infection. These tests could be especially useful for determining whether health care workers have some immunity and are at lower risk if they go back to work. Unlike other COVID-19 tests, the CoV-2 Rapid test can also determine current infection phase. A positive IgM value indicates an infection in the early phase of the disease (4 to 10 days), and a positive IgG value indicates a later phase (from 11 - 24 days).\r\n\r\nYALE UNIVERSITY STUDY\r\n\r\nA Yale University study concluded that this test is suitable for detecting IgM and IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 with high levels of sensitivity and specificity. IgG specificity is near-perfect (99.7-100%) over the entire cohort of 1,892 patient samples. This finding provides reassurance that this test will minimize the chance for false positive results. \r\n\r\nhttps://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.25.20112227v1.full.pdf",

Educators create and share projects that are assigned to students. \r\n\r\nPAIN POINTS:\r\n1) THERE IS NO EASY WAY TO MANAGE PASSION-BASED LEARNING. \r\nThere is a ton of free projects available content online, but it is not curated and personalizable and requires a lot of teacher time to manage. On our platform, parents enter the age, interests, and language skills and we build a tailored project for their kids. They can also create and share their projects with others.  \r\n\r\n2) CAN WE SOLVE CURATION \u0026 SUPERVISION? Yes. When kids are passionate about a project or problem, they require much less supervision. We add gamification so that course material is mastered at each stage. \r\n\r\n3) LOW-RESOURCE PARENTS AND KIDS WILL BE LEFT BEHIND. 1 billion kids are out of school. We are facing a critical widening of the educational gap; high-resource parents will be able to provide a rich learning environment at home but low-resource parents (low income, dual working parents, no internet access) will struggle.

With less enforcement of social distancing, people are not confident about going to stores. Over that, a lot of stores are closed or operating for a lesser duration than normal.  \r\n\r\nOur solution to the above problems is to \r\n- Evenly Spread Customer Visits at Different Times\r\n- Provide Customers with correct and updated opening status and information\r\n- Providing Customers with a Proof of Essential Travel (if any law enforcement agency asks for it)\r\n\r\nOur app, SafeSlot helps in implementing these solutions. When user opens the app, they can see the nearest stores based on their location. We plan to divide the store timings into various time slots with a maximum cap of registrations based on the store/counter size and let users book the slot for their essential shopping. For the same, users can book a maximum of two slots per day for any store. We also have an option of DriveThru option in which users can upload their grocery list/doctor's prescription and stores can pack it by the time they arrive at the store. Hence, reducing the customer visit time to an average of 5 minutes.\r\n",

We will use gamified functions to match users with opportunities to learn, grow, help and connect with others. By crowdsourcing classes, events and listening ears from other users wishing to connect, we can improve mental health outcomes by both giving purpose and giving access to socialization and coping mechanisms. In this way, we can reduce the burden on the healthcare system. ",

Our goal is to tackle the \"access to information\" problem which makes it difficult for people to take advantage of opportunities that exist out there. \r\n\r\nIt's a simple concept, but we believe supporting people's employment and finances is one of the most impactful things that can be done right now.

One of the most common questions we are asked by potential customers is if our technology can detect COVID-19.\r\n\r\nSince the COVID-19 virus particle is about 125nm in size, we have the ability to detect the presence of the particle, however, we cannot identify the virus - today. With additional funding for R\u0026D, we believe we can add the image processing technology component capable of identifying viruses in the 100nm-150nm range, including COVID-19.

      "description":"tl;dr: \r\nSMS chatbot to prescreen potential covid-19 sufferers (based on existing protocols). Update: We shipped product in 3 days.\r\n\r\nJoin our Slack Group: \r\nhttps://join.slack.com/t/covid9teen/shared_invite/zt-czt2azr7-iYFqn_VZ39bydd1~SnSkVA\r\n\r\nProblem:\r\nExisting health services are overwhelmed by inquiries (web, phone, ER, etc). Many are false positives (feel sick, but not covid-19). This takes testing resources away from true positives (feel sick and positive for covid-19).\r\n\r\nIn British Columbia, Canada, our current health service provider takes about a day to reply from a human SMS operator. A chatbot is a practical application because the task is repetitive and follows a sequential set of rules.\r\n\r\nObjective: \r\nInform concerned citizens at scale and reduce the burden on healthcare professionals.\r\n\r\nSolution (MVP):\r\nSupplement human-operated SMS with a chatbot, which follows the same self-assessment protocol. In Canada, the self-assessment tool is near-identical across all provinces:  https://myhealth.alberta.ca/journey/covid-19/Pages/COVID-Self-Assessment.aspx\r\n\r\nThis SMS solution can be customized for your own regional health authorities. We are looking to expand to other communication channels (e.g. Whatsapp, messenger, Intercom, etc.)\r\n\r\nSpecifics:\r\nUser texts “I feel sick” to (587)210-2300. The ~8 question screening tool is based on Yes/No replies (boolean). \r\n\r\nTo programmatically apply if/else statements, we're using Twilio Autopilot/functions. \r\n\r\nThis is the abridged version of the ~8 question survey:\r\n1. Are you experiencing severe difficult Breathing...Y/N\r\n2. Are you experiencing shortness of breath...Y/N\r\n3. Do you have any of the following: Fever, cough,...Y/N\r\n4A. Were you exposed to someone who has been confirmed as having COVID-19 within 14 days of your symptoms starting? Y/N\r\n5A. Did you travel outside Canada within 14 days of your symptoms starting? Y/N\r\n6A. Have you been in close contact with someone with respiratory illness in the past 14 days? Y/N\r\n7A. Had that person traveled outside of Canada within the past 28 days? Y/N\r\n8A. In the past 14 days have you returned from travel to any other locations outside of Canada? Y/N\r\n\r\nThe current protocol has 3 possible outcomes: \r\n1. Forward to 911 (emergency services)\r\n2. Forward to 811 (non emergency info line; your region may differ)\r\n3. No testing required.\r\n\r\nDeployment:\r\nAfter building a proof of concept, share it and/or give it away to your local/regional authorities for free. We may request large organizations (e.g. government/corporations) to cover ongoing maintenance costs ($/SMS).\r\n\r\nUpdate:\r\nAfter 72 hours, we have launched the SMS - Congrats, team Covid9teen!\r\n\r\nProduct Development:\r\n• Expand to other channels (e.g. Whatsapp, Messenger, intercom, etc)\r\n• Shortcode SMS (e.g. Text \"I feel sick\" to 123123). Note: Applications for shortcode SMS take over a month for approval and costs \u003e$1000. Source: https://www.twilio.com/shortcode/short-code-type\r\n• Calculate the probability of a user having Covid-19 by taking the users input (e.g. symptoms, location, age, etc) and comparing it with known symptoms provided by the WHO. Source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOJqHPfG7pA\r\n\r\nBenefits to you:\r\n• Skills in chatbot development\r\n• Product manage your own region\r\n• Potential Machine learning applications\r\n• Join the fight against Covid-19",

This is not only related to COVID19, but also to the flu and colds in more general, as we'd expect to see some physiological changes – e.g. in resting heart rate, blood oxygen saturation, body temperature – in all of those cases. It could be extremely useful if we could predict falling sick using these data at a point before one is consciously aware of it. We are planning to do a collaborative community science project in which we will try to use both retrospective data and ongoing data collections to address this question. Worst case we'll learn that wearable data signals are too weak to make predictions, best case we'll figure out how to predict sickness some days in advance.\r\n\r\nYou can read more details at https://app.jogl.io/project/135#about ",

In resource-rich countries, a patient on contact isolation will have a dedicated \"disposable\" stethoscope during their hospital admission. These are typically poor quality and of limited utility. They are also quite short -- resulting in close physical proximity to an ill patient, which increases risk of droplet contamination on PPE and individuals.\r\n\r\nAs with other supplies and equipment, I expect need will vastly outstrip supply due to the lack of machines and need to clean these items between patients.\r\n\r\nI am asking all the talented people on this forum to help design an (1) inexpensive (2) Bluetooth-enabled stethoscope bell to reduce very-close proximity exposure for healthcare workers and enhance existing supplies chains for this medical equipment.

This project seeks to encourage the production of such cabinets with the following key characteristics:\r\n\r\n1) constructed from a design which has been tested for its effectiveness in decontaminating FFR masks against the SARS-Cov-2 virus as well as for its operator safety. Above all else the cabinet must be safe.\r\n2) built at home using cheap, readily available components. DIY construction avoids the need for setting-up manufacturing facilities, distribution, etc.\r\n3) checked for use at each location according to applicable regulations. The use of a DIY appliance at a hospital or GP surgery needs careful consideration, but at a minimum an electrician will need to check the cabinet is constructed according to the design and is safe to use.\r\n4) used according to Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) for the design. A key part of the design is the production of clear instructions for the safe use of the cabinet which can be adapted for local requirements.\r\n\r\nWe envisage that multiple groups will undertake the development of a design and its subsequent testing. This project aims to support such groups by sharing information and providing common standards. We will also act as a central resource for DIY people seeking to select a verified design from which to build their own cabinets.\r\n\r\nWe are particularly interested in getting volunteers associated with Universities, particularly undergrads. This is because University labs are more likely to have the equipment and expertise necessary to undertake the testing and will hopeful support their own students in such a project.\r\n",

We need to stop waiting on the government and OWN this responsibility. While people are \"staying inside,\" it is not enough. At the time of this writing on 4/12/2020 there are 1.8M cases, 113k deaths. The U.S. is the most alarming with 311k cases and 8500 deaths. We cannot WAIT for the government to take action, it is already too late. We need to build an app fast so that people take the pledge with us and join our movement. The app will use GPS to know if someone left their house or not. The idea is for each user to challenge themselves by staying in as long as they can. If they leave their home or a geofence, they are disqualified. Users will earn points by staying in everyday, and they can post to social media that they have \"Saved X Lives by Staying in for X Days.\" Users will be able to set up groups and view leaderboards against their friends. They will also be able to set up \"Challenges\" similar to FitBit challenges. We will use gamification and incentivize users to almost NEVER leave their homes unless they desperately need to. We will get Companies to contribute and donate prizes. For example, if someone can complete 7 days of not leaving their home, they will earn a free 3-month subscription to Netflix. The second and third week of April is supposed to be the worst months. We have a limited window to build this and create something that may save the world. Join our movement as we are mobilized millions of people to take our challenge and pledge to stay home. *This app will be available for everyone in the world.*",

We have provided not only COVIDx, a large dataset of over 16,000 images across over 13,000 patient cases, but also open source reference models trained on this dataset so that the global community can built upon and improve. \r\n\r\nBy leveraging deep learning AI with COVID-Net, we aim to help clinicians improve both sensitivity and specificity by better differentiate COVID-19 infections from other forms of viral infections, which is a current challenge faced given their similarities, as well as assist clinicians with additional knowledge about how COVID-Net detects COVID-19 infections through AI explanations.  Furthermore, we aim to build deep learning AI for risk stratification to aid hospitals and clinical sites to help improve patient population management and individualized care based on risk level.  \r\n ",

      "description":"Welsome (https://welsome.org) is a self-improvement and impact social platform where we can improve ourselves with our actions, and in the process, the planet. The main premise of Welsome is action-feeds. Now and again we keep seeing social media news feeds; however, my goal is to turn information into actions with action feeds in order to foster a social platform for accountability. What this means specifically for the coronavirus pandemic, is users can subscribe to actions they care about (e.g. health, preventing Covid-19, happiness, relationships, etc.) and can be part of a community that both creates and consumes actions related to these categories. The users can then challenge each other, communicate, and hold themselves accountable. For instance, a work/living community or friend group can start a collaborative challenge amongst each other through Welsome to do more actions that are related to Covid-19 (e.g. what WHO and NIH recommend such as washing hands, staying 6 feet away, etc.). The users can also challenge and reward each other if they meet their goals and can form mentor/mentee relationships over time to improve in the activities they care about doing. Another useful feature of Welsome would be the activity reminders and statistics throughout the day such as \"Don't forget to wash your hands!\" or \"Your local authorities just issued a shelter-in-place order.\" to remind and educate people about preventing or coping with the coronavirus problem. The goal is that by starting at the source and holding people accountable for their actions, we can be better equipped at solving the Covid-19 problem by preventing the coronavirus outbreak from progressing any further. Most of the actions from this example are available on Welsome at the moment and of these features are functional now; however, I am still currently in the feature refinement and user-interview phase and will launch and Android/iOS app very soon (few weeks) given the overwhelming feedback to do so from users.",

      "description":"Who are we? We're Gathrer. We built a scalable and beautiful directory, with a spam-less uber-like signalling communication tool to ping people for help. Reach thousands of people in a click. We will build Covid-19 college town communities using what we already made to connect people who can help and need help.\r\n\r\nFirst, watch - \r\n\r\n- A video of our directory app https://tinyurl.com/v6fool5\r\n- This video https://youtu.be/-RgzQEJutE4?t=343 from 6:40 - 10:00\r\n\r\n\r\nHow did we start? I started a Gathrer as a unincorporated disaster relief data gathering project in 2017 and we successfully gathered data in the aftermath of the Grenfell Tower incident in London. We were featured in New York Times having gathered data far ahead of police estimates. Last year, I decided I would expand the Gathrer brand.\r\n\r\nWhat are we now? We're a beautiful directory tool with a new communication protocol called \"signalling and listening\". This is a little like a demand, supply matcher or event listener. Signalling and listening means any user in any given community e.g. San Francisco, can click a button and ping any type of member for a given purpose, without spam.\r\n\r\nE.g. *Ping / signal* [all young people] in [San Francisco] to [help] with [grocery shopping] -\u003e Anyone *listening* to [help] from [profile with attributes of the pingers] for [grocery shopping] in [San Francisco] gets a [ping!]\r\n\r\nHow will we roll this out for Covid-19? We built a way for this to work in college towns and would start by rolling out there. Let's connect college students with those who need help. Why college students? They're in the same geographic area so they can help each other, and easy to authenticate.\r\n\r\nDoes this communication protocol work? Yes. We tested this functionality at https://www.intelligentcrazypeople.com. Members of the Intelligent Crazy People community included folks like former founders and CEOs of Skype, Reddit and so on. I also created that community myself and we've had 8000 applications, 2000 members and 100 meetups thus far.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nA 2nd use case - \r\n\r\nWhat are other applications to Covid-19? Our research suggests our directory tool will be a great way for remote employees within the same companies or ecosystems to quickly search for and contact each other. This should make remote working more manageable during the quarantine periods of Covid-19 outbreak.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThis is a for-profit project, but any signalling activity around Covid-19 will not be monetised. Furthermore we are not asking for free help necessarily.",

Our engineers are ready to go and we can start by rolling out Covid-19 signals to key towns connecting college students with each other or those in need of help.\r\n\r\nA founder of an energy company who raised up to $70 million from investors like Bill Gates is in on the round.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nOther help for free or paid:\r\n\r\nWe are also happy for any kind of help, free or not free to move this forward, especially to solve problems emerging as a result of Covid-19. If you offer free help we would offer warm introductions or help as thanks.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nAdvisors:\r\n\r\nLooking for any kind of advisor ideally who has helped build or grown a successful tool or company.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

      "description":"The following is an idea which might limit airborne transmission in hospitals, skilled nursing facilities, assisted living facilities, etc. I would hope that someone could look into it and, if they find it plausible, pursue implementation of it.\r\n\r\nThe concept involves the use of negative ions.\r\n\r\nIn a nutshell, the theory behind negative ion generating devices is that the negative ions that are created weigh down any particulates in the air (including microorganisms) and cause them to fall to the ground. This type of effect can be seen in the approach of a strong rain storm with considerable lightning; the air suddenly becomes discernibly fresh and clean because of the negative ions created in the storm. If negative ion generators can indeed cause microorganisms (including viruses) to fall to the ground, they have great potential for limiting the exposure of people in buildings to any airborne Covid-19 in the area. It might also be possible that the generators can kill viruses directly. The proposed types of buildings are hospitals, skilled nursing facilities, assisted living facilities and other health related facilities.\r\n\r\nA basic objections to negative ion generators is that some machines create ozone as a byproduct, a substance which can be deemed harmful at high levels. As an aside, high amounts of ozone in the air can effectively kill all viruses in the area, but you could only do this with empty rooms or wings of buildings.\r\n\r\nI do not have a final and definitive answer regarding the feasibility of such devices. But, if others were to do intensive research and conclude that these devices could be a significant contribution in the fight against Covid-19, I would envision that high capacity units that do not emit ozone could be installed in the facilities as mentioned above. It may not be feasible to place devices in every room of a facility, but at least hallways and public areas should be considered. Studies could be performed which look at the infection rate at facilities with the devices and those without the devices.\r\n\r\nAt some point, private companies could consider installing these devices in locations they deem worthwhile. Then we have airplanes, buses, subways, auditoriums, etc.\r\n\r\nAll I am asking at this stage is for someone to confirm whether or not the overall concept has merit and, if so, get governmental experts to thoroughly investigate negative ion generators and determine whether they truly offer any hope.\r\n\r\nThe following a some pertinent links to help in this regard.\r\n\r\nSuccessful study with viruses: https://www.nature.com/articles/srep11431\r\n\r\nIonizer destroys acinobacter in hospital: https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn3228-air-ionisers-wipe-out-hospital-infections/\r\n\r\nAn aircraft ionization system: https://www.ainonline.com/aviation-news/business-aviation/2015-10-09/ionization-system-removes-pathogens-cabin-air\r\n\r\nActive against Salmonella: https://agresearchmag.ars.usda.gov/2000/mar/salm\r\n\r\nA listing of studies compiled by a manufacturer: https://www.surroundair.com/negative-ions/\r\n\r\nEffective against Newcastle virus: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2130090/pdf/jhyg00043-0066.pdf\r\n\r\nThis discusses only ozone: http://www.china.org.cn/opinion/2020-02/26/content_75747237_4.htm ; https://www.ozonepartner.com/poultry",

Above all, it is a matter of maintaining social distance to protect against new infections. Especially in supermarkets, it is very difficult to keep the distance from people because everybody eventually needs food. So how can we supply everyone with food and still reach a much smaller number of people in the supermarkets? That's when the idea came up: if I'm going shopping for myself anyway, why not go shopping for my neighbours as well? Here the story of Nexd begins.\r\n\r\nThe app is designed to help everyone, whether they have a smartphone or not. People with smartphones can select their desired items in the app, specify the quantity and upload it as a shopping list. Helpers nearby see these shopping lists and process them when they are out getting their groceries. Now to the unique selling point: People without a smartphone can call a unique number nationwide. Here they can speak their wishes on tape. The recording is loaded into the app, where helpers nationwide can listen to it and convert it into a written list. These digitalised shopping lists are then available for processing by helpers nearby to the people making the lists. The helpers can choose as many shopping lists as they want and buy the items for them. Afterwards, they are brought to the people in quarantine. The payment process is currently managed by the helpers and seekers, but the implementation of payment processes like PayPal and such are planned.",

There are a wide variety of machines made by a number of different manufacturers at hospitals around the world, and there is no single resource for how to repair all of them. We don’t know how many machines will fail once hospitals are truly taxed. We don’t know which parts of those machines are most at risk.\r\n\r\nSome manufacturers heroically host service manuals for their equipment on their website, and some make them more challenging to locate. There is no single source of information for biomeds to access. Biomed forums are frequently populated with requests for specific PDF service manuals. The closest thing to a central resource is Frank’s Hospital Workshop, a fantastic website run out of Tanzania with hundreds of manuals and very helpful how-to resources for maintaining medical equipment. But Frank’s site is a one-person operation, and a single point of failure, should overwhelming traffic come calling.\r\n\r\nWe’re going to change that. Our biomed technicians’ time is too precious to waste on internet Easter-egg hunts. iFixit is building a central resource for maintenance and repair of hospital equipment.

      "description":"In the current situation with Covid-19, it has become difficult for people to buy hand cleansers and multiple gloves to carry along with them. Thus, when shopping and conducting other daily activities, there is a high probability that their hands will come into contact with a virus laden surface. To resolve this situation, I invite you to view links (below) which my casual research uncovered. As you will see, they discuss the invention by various entities of permanent or semi-permanent coatings or paints for use on various items (handrails, medical equipment, etc.), which can essentially kill viruses on contact. I am sure that other coatings of a similar nature exist.\r\nMy idea reverses the intent of the invented coatings. They were all designed to coat surfaces which people would likely touch with a bare (or even gloved) hand. It would be practically impossible to go around right now and retrofit all touchable surfaces with these coatings. So, why not put the coatings on the hands of the \"touchers?\"\r\nJust imagine if a virus-killing coating could be applied to a multi-use, durable “glove” which a person could attach to a hook on a belt for easy access on their daily routine. In whatever design is chosen, the virus-killing coating would at least be on the palmar surface (the entire surface would be ideal). Although people should avoid touching the outer surface of standard gloves once they have been used in the public realm, they are not always be able to follow this dictate and the entire purpose for wearing the gloves (no personal contact) is defeated. Also, they often wear gloves all day long, potentially transferring a virus from one location to another. However, in the proposed glove with the special coating, since any virus that got onto its surface would had almost assuredly been killed in short order by the surface's coating, the overall risk for any transmission to the user by accidental touching would be minimal. Such gloves would also result in a greatly reduced virus spread from and between surfaces, such as: gasoline pump handles; door handles; scanners; keypads; pens; counter tops; tables; etc. For example, if a person with one of these gloves grabs a gasoline pump handle, a virus on the handle could get on the glove. There it would be killed in short order. When the person then goes to a big box store and uses a scanner, he will not transmit any live virus which may have hitched a ride from the gas pump handle. And so on. In contrast, if a person used traditional (and now rare) latex gloves; we could not rely upon them to remove and replace the gloves after performing various tasks as discussed in the preceding. They would accidentally end up contaminating various objects, and themselves, without realizing it.\r\nIn essence, this concept eliminates the need to change gloves constantly or change gloves in a precise manner to prevent contact transmission. The virus-killing surface effectively assumes that responsibility. This is not meant to interfere with the current gloving procedures in medical facilities.\r\nTo be effective, gloves would need to be mass produced and made available to everyone, for free. Furthermore, businesses, schools, etc. would need to deny access to anyone who is not wearing these gloves. Yes, that would be a massive endeavor, but the country cannot remain shut down forever.\r\nUltimately, this idea would require someone to coordinate with the national government.\r\nHere are the links:\r\nhttps://www.thehindubusinessline.com/news/science/virucidal-coating-to-prevent-covid-19-transmission/article31411777.ece\r\n\r\nhttps://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/04/090420121425.htm\r\n\r\nhttps://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2019/08/190801142534.htm\r\n\r\nhttps://www.biospace.com/article/releases/epa-approved-antimicrobial-surface-coating-represents-breakthrough-in-the-control-and-spread-of-infectious-diseases/\r\n\r\nhttps://www.omicsonline.org/open-access/effectiveness-of-nanomaterial-copper-cold-spray-surfaces-on-inactivationof-influenza-a-virus-2155-952X-1000205.php?aid=64558\r\n\r\nhttps://patents.google.com/patent/WO2008127416A2/en\r\n\r\nhttps://www.wral.com/lifestyles/healthteam/video/1108435/\r\n\r\nhttps://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2018/RA/C8RA01985A#!divAbstract\r\n\r\nhttps://www.biocote.com/blog/5-benefits-antimicrobial-paint/\r\n\r\nhttps://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/1044961\r\n\r\nhttps://www.nanowerk.com/news/newsid=13045.php\r\n\r\nhttps://aabme.asme.org/posts/special-surface-coating-can-kill-most-bacteria-and-viruses-on-contact\r\n\r\nhttps://www.pnas.org/content/103/47/17667\r\n\r\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1693804/\r\n\r\nhttps://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/antibacterial-coating\r\n\r\nhttps://physicsworld.com/a/antimicrobial-coating-kills-multi-resistant-pathogens-on-the-iss/\r\n\r\nhttps://bmcmicrobiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12866-016-0675-x\r\n\r\nhttps://www.researchgate.net/publication/6695607_Polymeric_coatings_that_inactivate_both_influenza_virus_and_pathogenic_bacteria\r\n\r\nhttps://www.scientificamerican.com/article/paint-on-polymer-kills-fl/\r\n\r\nhttps://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2018/ra/c8ra01985a#!divAbstract\r\n\r\nhttps://www.manchester.ac.uk/discover/news/unique-new-antiviral-treatment-made-using-sugar/    ",

This would aims to achieve two important goals: to inform the population about their risks as well as how to get help, and put pressure on local and national governments to improve infrastructure resilience. Starting with Covid19 epidemic, we see an opportunity to take this work much further, and aim at global mitigation of climate risks, and global disaster scenario analysis. \r\n\r\nNON-PRODUCTION deployment here: https://hocup-info.firebaseapp.com/",

One of them is Metric Technologies. \r\n\r\nWe've been working on a low cost, basic ventilator. One of us led a group at Rice University who developed a working prototype that will meet the global COVID needs - though in a non-intuitive way.\r\n\r\nI have a team of front-line intensive care docs, pulmonary mechanics PhDs, and experienced engineers that are ramping up to take this on. Given our current resources we are projecting a maximum 3 month time-frame to develop a product and hand it off to regulators. Expected cost per unit under $300.\r\n \r\nWith more resources  (more engineers, a manufacturing partner, a stream-lined regulatory approval process, money, distribution partners) we could shave another 2-6 weeks off that.\r\n\r\nUltimately out goal is to get ventilators, AND a deployment, logistical strategy to clinicians and health systems globally to save lives.\r\n \r\nIt's actually more complicated than dumping new cheap vents in hospitals. For the most serious cases of COVID SARS, pretty advanced forms of ventilatory support will be required (ARDSnet protocols etc).  Plus there will be a need for training, support, skilled staff, beds etc... all systems we're comfortable building. And that's not to mention all of the special exemptions we will need to get these ventilators in the hospitals themselves. You can't just use an untrusted, unproven device on patients.\r\n \r\nWe have a strategy that addresses all of that.\r\n \r\nNew, cheap ventilators will help, but I believe that there is more to the discussion and solution than an engineering project. Our group understands the problem, has a breadth and depth of relevant expertise, and with a little (lot! of) support could get this done quicker and better. We are looking for collaborators, supporters, funders, critiquers.\r\n\r\nAsking for help. Happy to talk and share ideas.

See links below. The equipment needed is relatively cheap (\u003c100k), and the lab techniques needed can be learned in a few days.

To date, this represents a novel approach to vaccine development.

For long term production, stable transduction will be achieved with a Lentiviral system. Stark Therapeutics is partnering with Perception Biosystems and was funded by WeFunder’s \"Fight the Virus\" challenge. \r\n\r\nWe need lab techs to help on cultivating cell lines and chromatography (nickel IMAC, SEC, heparin).

      "description":"The following describes a project brief and articulates what we are trying to achieve. Please help, this can be powerful. \r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nDespite global awareness of the impacts and consequences of COVID-19, we aren’t doing enough. We need to do more, we need to do it better, and we need to do it now. \r\n\r\nReducing the spread comes down to reducing the amount of physical touch points between humans. It’s that simple, and that complex. 6Plus is an agreed undertaking of the practice we now all know as social distancing. It’s a community to support and encourage increasing the physical separation between us while also increasing the human connection between us. It’s agreeing to a common set of principles that form one promise: to do the best we can. \r\n\r\nMore than a commitment to today, it’s a commitment to tomorrow. We don’t know how long we will be called to change our social behaviours, and it’s not going to be easy. As we adjust to a new state of normal, we are going to want to give up and we will want to bend the rules. This is an ask of ourselves and each other to continue onwards and through.\r\n\r\nNow is the time to act, and now is the time to act together. Let’s make the new majority.\r\n\r\nTHE COMMUNITY\r\n\r\nThe name 6Plus represents the most straightforward way to socially distance: stay physically separated by at least 2 metres, or 6 feet. But this commitment is more than a circumference, and rather than creating an exclusionary zone it fosters a (digital) togetherness.\r\n\r\nIt is also a ring of those who you trust, and those who you want to be protected. Who is in your 6Plus? It’s better if you’re all in it together.\r\n\r\nWe wear our identity with pride. We share the principles widely. And we learn to create belonging amongst ourselves in fresh, yet unexplored new ways. Who would have thought that something requiring us to stay apart would bring us closer together?\r\n\r\nTHE PLEDGE\r\n\r\nThe pledge is a set of suggestions belonging to a community who wants to help each other navigate this new, globally-shared experience. Add yourself to the growing numbers of those across the world committed to responsible action and encompassing support. \r\n\r\nThis pledge says that you will:\r\n1. Stay, whenever and wherever possible, at least 2 metres or 6 feet away from your fellow humans, being physically separated from anyone you can\r\n2. Reduce time spent in public spaces unless necessary, even if your governing bodies have not yet required it\r\n3. Choose not to attend gatherings of more than a handful of people (more than 6) physically together\r\n4. Commit to additional cleanliness, such as hand washing more than might feel comfortable or natural and disinfecting surfaces and objects before and after interacting with them\r\n5. Remain digitally connected and socially linked with friends, family and colleagues, working together to find with new ways to mitigate the downsides of isolation \r\n6. Doing what you can to support others, including those who are not as digitally connected, while adhering to the other principles\r\n7. Encourage others to learn more\r\n\r\nJOIN THE COMMUNITY\r\n\r\n1. Download or order the 6Plus badge in whatever form best suits you, or use the creative commons to create your own.

It could be an enormous opportunity to learn how the virus spread via our social networks, thus helping to prevent it from spreading further. \r\n\r\nIndividuals could be empowered to make informed decisions when someone in their network gets sick with flu and that someone had just met a person that tested positive for Covid-19 - even more so if the person is close to someone in the risk group.\r\n\r\nSONA app lets you:\r\n(1) visualise social networks,\r\n(2) share health status (C19-positive, healthy, sick, risk group),\r\n(3) calculates probability to get sick\r\n(4) log symptoms and\r\n(5) get alerts when someone in your network gets sick and alert other when you get sick\r\n\r\nWe are looking for people to help us in bringing this idea to life!",

      "description":"The World Health Organization has indicated that it will be approximately 18 months before a vaccine for COVID-19 is developed. Using our approach will be more effective in vaccine development and will take half the amount of time it would take WHO to develop a vaccine. I can provide a detailed writeup explaining the pathway/process. \r\n\r\nWe propose to harness information encoded by the immune system during active infection to generate therapeutic antibodies and develop vaccines (see model). Our approach is to capture information on immune responses from the active viral infection, amplify this response to develop cells that actively responded to infection. This information is then utilized to produce neutralizing antibodies for treating infected patients. Antibodies produced by B cells generated by our process are utilized to identify antigens using nano/LC/MS/MS for use in vaccine development. Our approach develops a database of all viral antigens to which infected patients body responded. Information gathered will also be useful to assess the efficacy of RNA based vaccines (Moderna and CureVac). Delivery for RNA vaccines is still challenging, and stability remains an issue. Our approach is far superior than any existing vaccine development technology and does not rely on injecting whole heat killed or attenuated pathogen. These old technologies are not only inferior, but they provide only partial protection and may show adverse events. We provide an opportunity to develop a tool kit to quickly respond to viral threats rapidly and cost effectively. ",

This platform (helpwithcovid) is the true example of a place where experts in technology unite to help others with their expertise. But what about the knowledge? Where is it stored? Who can have access to it? Can a person in Mozambique or Indonesia replicate the Corona Tracking software and deploy it at the same pace as an American or Chinese developer? What about good practices in many cities and countries that are being invisible just because they didn't reach the right communication channel?\r\n\r\nI really believe that a open access approach is the only way in which we are going to democratize the fight against covi-19. There is no other way. \r\n\r\nThere are some efforts like the the https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/ that are creating repositories of api’s and other code related to corona. This is a incredible page and all the environment that JOINUP has created since it launched is impressive, but there are several things to keep in mind: is very centered to the EU, is completely in english and is a passive repository, meaning that solutions and data are being sent to the page, then reviewed and then uploaded. What if we do the same but we add the secret element of proactiveness?\r\n\r\nWe could have the best platform in the world but if no one adds anything and at the end no one uses it, then what is the objective of nurturing the platform? We need to be proactive. We need a platform and a team of people that actively seeks partners, alliances, resources and communication channels to reach all of the possible stakeholders that could be interested in deploying this data or vice versa, trying to share their code with other fellow stakeholders.\r\n\r\nSo the project consists of two things:\r\nA web-based platform that enables data sharing\r\nA team of people that actively reach out stakeholders (e.g governments, networks, ngos, etc). \r\n\r\nWhat type of data while be available to upload?\r\n\r\nCode\r\nSocioeconomic and health data\r\nAPI’s\r\nComplete APPs\r\nOther resources like blueprints (for masks, ventilators, etc)\r\nPolicy reports and public solutions that could be evaluated as successful\r\nOther stuff related to covid and that is important to be public and accesible.\r\n\r\nWho can upload?\r\n\r\nEveryone, but there is a revision of the resource after uploading to the repository\r\n\r\nPrimarily, I believe that the stakeholders that created the data or solution need to be the ones that upload their assets. \r\n\r\nSo thats it… any questions?\r\n\r\nGo to: https://gitter.im/COVID-19-Open-Source-Team/community?utm_source=share-link\u0026utm_medium=link\u0026utm_campaign=share-link\r\n\r\nor \r\n\r\nhttps://discord.gg/CvY86JP",

We want to find a way to get others similar levels of help so they can get the money as quickly and easily as the large banks and corporations.\r\n__________________\r\nCONTEXT\r\n\r\nUnprecedented government debt and stimulus spending is ahead. Direct relief to humans and small businesses will minimize suffering and economic loss. Hundreds of billions in loans \u0026 grants need to be made by the government in the days ahead\r\n\r\nProblem: \r\nHow will it get to the right firms fast enough -- without fraud and loss of accountability? How can the existing infrastructure be scaled in days Vs months/years?\r\n\r\nSolution needed: \r\nTechnology enabled form population and diligence, to process loans faster and scale oversight will be needed to help agencies like the SBA process, manage and administer the loans\r\n\r\nThe opportunity: This must be done efficiently and quickly to maximize the funds going to the right firms on time, without fraud. I think we must help.\r\n\r\n__________________\r\nSCALE OF THE PROBLEM\r\n\"The SBA’s capacity presents a major potential implementation challenge. Across its lending platforms, SBA approved $28.2 billion in loans in FY 2019 – 8 percent of what it is being asked to distribute in short order. In order to overcome these challenges, the process will have to be streamlined to an extraordinary degree. In addition, the agency’s budget request for 2020 was $820 million, of which less than half would support direct lending assistance. $349 billion effectively equals roughly one thousand times the usual annual guaranty amount, delivered in only two months.\r\n\r\nThe CARES Act requires certain documentation from businesses in order to apply. These documents include payroll records, mortgage or rent information, and “any other information the [SBA] Administrator deems necessary.” In order to facilitate the large quantity of expected loans, the SBA will likely need to establish very concise criteria.\r\n\r\nOnce the lender has the required information, it needs to submit the loan to the SBA. The current online platform’s bandwidth will likely be taxed by the sheer volume of loans made. The loan submission process is also time consuming, considering the expected volume. Finally, the SBA will have to figure out how to get the money appropriated by Congress out the door to pay lenders for the forgiven portion of loans in as seamless a fashion as possible to keep up with anticipated demand.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nRead more: https://www.americanactionforum.org/insight/operationalizing-small-business-emergency-loan-relief/",

Ie changing the supply chain in this ‘x’ way – has this ‘y’ effect. And to make an efficient path to distribute findings to people during the rebuilding process to help them make an environmental choice, without them having to lose precious time. \r\n\r\nWe will need an environmental overview during the crisis, tracking what impact changing behaviours have. This does not just mean getting good sources for existing data, although that is a given, it is about looking at countries’ environmental footprints, discovering what changes were taking place and using that as an attribution model for that country.  So these will not be a bland one size fits all but exactly contextual. We communicate the solutions that have been the most effective to the specific problems that were being solved. This will do two things. Help guide people on what solutions are out there and make the environmental impact a part of the buying decision set \r\n\r\nChallenges\r\n\r\nWhereas the environmental challenge up until now has been to speed up environmental behavioural changes – the new challenge for environmentalists will now be a case of slowing people down to take zero carbon emissions into account as they rush to rebuild a semblance of normality.\r\n\r\nStrengths of this project\r\n\r\nJust a few months ago we all believed that the kind of mindset reset that was necessary to reduce carbon emissions was years away not days and weeks.\r\nIt was believed impossible for us to;\r\n•\tReduce how much we ‘needed’ to travel – particularly flying\r\n•\tApproach updating our (aging) existing supply chains because of the prohibitive expensive in reengineering them\r\n•\tRelinquish the western obsession with consumerism and putting money first\r\n•\tMove governments faster than the need to produce lengthy reports and guaranteed outcomes would allow\r\nYet here we are doing it all today.\r\n\r\nPart of what we will need to do as a global community is to get people emotionally to balance the dichotomy of being in an isolationist reality, when we need them engaged in collaborative creativity? Social Isolation vs Social Closeness. (Dr Eric Rasmussen). This project can be very helpful here. There is a lot that we can take away from this period to help convince people more long term. We want to use facts to do this. Rather than feel-good words. \r\n\r\n#covid19toco2zero\r\n\r\n",

      "description":"Eleutherios (https://eleutherios.org.nz) is a circular supply chain that lets people or businesses serve one another at scale via the internet. It does this by scaling or serializing the customers forum or request, so that one or more people, businesses or supply chains can serve the customer or in their forum at the same time.\r\n\r\n# Problem\r\n\r\nThe current human supply chain is linear or tries to scale the service or work that people or businesses are trying to perform, not the forum, request or conversation that they are having. For example, if a person was hungry and had $10 to buy food, they might order online and spend $5 on a pizza, $2 on a drink and $3 to have the items delivered to their house.\r\n\r\nIn this scenario the person can only scale their request or conversation for food, three times. Once for pizza, a second time for a drink and a third time for a delivery service.\r\n\r\nThe problem is that the financial supply chain is the service that is doing the scaling of the request.\r\n\r\nrequest = $5 (finance) for pizza (food)\r\nrequest = $2 (finance) for drink (food)\r\nrequest = $2 (finance) for delivery (logistic)\r\n\r\n# Solution\r\n\r\nCircularize or serialize the forum, request or conversation that people or businesses are having not the service or work that they are trying to perform.\r\n\r\nBy subscribing to the idea that service or work is constant, we can use that as the input for a computer or Turing machine to aggregate or output as a forum, request or conversation.\r\n\r\nFor example, if a person was hungry and isolated at home, they could register with Eleutherios and create a forum for some food. A food store owner could register as a service in the system and subscribe to the forum and ask the person what food they wanted? The food store owner could gather the food from their store and scale the forum by creating a sub-forum for a healthcare worker to help with the delivery of the food. The healthcare worker could scale the sub-forum again and create another sub-forum for a delivery service and accompany the delivery service and be the person that delivers the food to the isolated person.\r\n\r\nIn the above example, Eleutherios is scaling or delegating the responsibility for managing the forum or request to four different people, businesses or supply chains. The civilian, food, healthcare and logistics supply chain.\r\n\r\n# Features\r\n\r\n1. Forum in forum (sustainable/manageable).\r\n2. Tags for filtering forums or services (searchable).\r\n3. Alerts to keep users informed when new forums or services are created in the system (notifiable).\r\n4. Blocking to prevent unwanted services or users from serving in forums they have been asked not to serve in or for requesting services, they have been asked not to request (accountable).\r\n5. Service reviews (accountable)\r\n6. B2B or shared processing (scalable)\r\n7. AI (automatable)\r\n\r\nEleutherios is built with an HTML/javascript (Angular) frontend and node.js (nosql/firebase) backend. https://eleutherios.org.nz\r\n\r\nDiscuss or provide feedback. https://www.facebook.com/groups/2982366048442234/\r\n\r\nHelp fix bugs or resolve issues. https://github.com/aletheon/eleutherios-alpha/issues\r\n\r\nMake a donation to the Eleutherios open source project. https://opencollective.com/eleutherios",

This project can team up with those projects.\r\nhttps://helpwithcovid.com/projects/27\r\nhttps://helpwithcovid.com/projects/47\r\n\r\nContext:\r\nI am one of the many in USA who can afford to give up my salary for a few months without having to worry about any kind of impact to my life whatsoever. I want to help middle and low income families in our local community who have been self-sufficient till now but suddenly find themselves in a dire situation due to losing their job or forced to be on loss of pay because of the COVID-19 outbreak. If everyone in an advantageous position like me is willing to donate their salary, I believe we can help a large number of families sail through these tough times with a little extra comfort and peace of mind. \r\n\r\nI fear the situation with the COVID-19 pandemic is going to get severely worse over the next few months, before any sense of relief arrives and even after there could be long lasting effect economically and mentally on significant % of the population. Such a planet-wide catastrophe demands everyone to act in anyway they can to support our family, our friends, our community, our country and every human being on this planet.\r\n\r\n#DonateMySalary",

      "name":"Reducing the susceptibility to Covid-19 infection with well-research natural components",
      "description":"It is common knowledge by now that a large proportion of the people who have contracted Covid-19 and were severely incapacitated, or died, often had concurrent medical conditions such as diabetes, heart disease, a history of smoking and so forth.  It is wise counsel for people currently with such conditions to take great caution when venturing out, encountering other people or entering new environments so that they may avoid getting infected.  \r\n\r\nMost people with such conditions are under a physician’s care and receive appropriate treatment, from the perspective of traditional medicine as practiced in the U.S.  In this concept, I propose that physicians venture out a little bit more, into the domain of nutrition (and related fields), and explore whether or not the constituents of what people consume or fail to consume might have a bearing on if a person shrugs off Covid-19 or comes down with a full blown illness.  Some of these “fail to consume” components may not actually be commonplace in the average diet, at least at the levels that would be of benefit.  It could also be possible that a person actually consumes what would be deemed an adequate level of something, but a medication, some other consumed component or a medical condition may cause its depletion.  I will be proposing that the consumption of certain researched “natural” constituents, in supplement form, be promoted for long time and/or acute use, particularly among those at high risk.  This will be elaborated on below.   \r\n\r\nAs an enticement to this approach, I will be presenting some randomly discovered examples of components which might help in our fight.  They specifically relate to viruses, influenza or Covid-19 itself.  Please note that as to non-processed herbal candidates, even if they come across as appealing, I am excluding them from the list.  If they were to be distributed in their least-processed form on a massive scale, it would be exceedingly difficult for their quality could be monitored for any adulteration.  Furthermore, it is unlikely that the supply could meet the demand.  But herbal extracts might be subject to easier testing and greater trustworthiness.  \r\n\r\nIf this listing and the assertions made in the links concerning component benefits is found to be of interest, we would need a specific Federal agency or department to ensure that all available options will be considered for eventual public promotion.  One that comes to mind (there may be others) is the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health, at NIH.  \r\nI suggest this endeavor be accomplished through the following:  (1) The involved agency or department would conduct an extensive internet article search, with a high reliance on medical, nutritional and other life science journals regarding potential candidates that could inhibit or actively fight viral infections, with a focus on influenza and, of course, Covid-19.  Such a search should involve human studies, animal studies, historical incidents/occurrences and theoretical assertions.   It should involve all nations and languages.  (2)  In pursuing this research, the involved agency or department should post all of the citations and sources it has discovered and will review.   It should also post a list of components that are under consideration and cross reference them with the articles as mentioned.  (3) Concurrent with #1 and #2, the involved agency or department should put out a global call to alternative / complimentary medicine providers, colleges and publications for any input or guidance they may have.  Even anecdotal sources would be considered.  The list as discussed in #2, above, should assist potential contributors in determining whether they have anything to add. (4)  While the preceding steps are taking place, efforts should be made to somehow acquire special blood work from patients with different levels of Covid-19 infections, such as:  infected but no symptoms; infected with symptoms but no hospitalization; infected with hospitalization (but a good prognosis); and infected with hospitalization and a poor prognosis (death likely).  Such blood work should be designed to detect specific deficiencies and possibly other factors, such as genetic elements.  (5) Once a list is in hand, as derived through #1 and #3, above, it is hoped that a consensus might arise within the medical community, including governmental entities with a medical orientation, that supplementing with all or some of the components which research suggests as being helpful would be worthy of consideration by individual physicians when consulting their patients.  (6) It is hoped that the Federal government could develop a list of the preferred components and put out bids for companies to manufacture them, in various formulations and dosages, for public distribution.  In doing so, information should be provided concerning any known risks in taking any of the components concurrently with various medications or medical conditions.  (7) Should distribution be effected, the blood work as described in #5 should continue, to see if the supplementation had any effect on those who participated.  This should be of tremendous benefit in addressing any other viral pandemics which should arise.  \r\nNow for my list.

Winter Is Coming!\r\nSolutions in design challenge should address this Infodemic and future Infodemics.\r\nWHAT?\r\nThe Covid19 InfoImmunity Project invites teams and individuals to participate in:\r\nThe COVID19 Infodemic Design Challenge: A global, five-day, entirely online, collaborative design challenge aiming to inspire solutions to the massive ‘Infodemic’ defined by the WHO as - the over-abundance of COVID19 information – some accurate and some not – that makes it hard for people to find trustworthy sources and reliable guidance when they need it. The challenge will build on the World Health Organization Infodemic Management Framework.\r\nThe COVID19 InfoImmunity Project enables all of us to think and learn together in order to generate and harness new levels of collective intelligence to fight the Infodemic. No one person or organization can do it alone. We need each other and we need you.\r\nWHO?\r\nThe design challenge is open to people and teams from around the world passionate about making a change...students, visionaries, healthcare professionals, researchers, entrepreneurs, media, tech philosophers, caretakers, truth seekers, influencers, marketers, writers, developers, innovators, designers, scientists, consultants, creative rebels, investors, explorers, artists, moms, dads, young, old, and in between…..sign up if you are courageous enough to make a difference.",

In this study, we are interested in learning about the ways in which COVID-19 has impacted science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) students and professionals personally, academically, and/or professionally. The results will be used to inform higher education and scientific institutions about these experiences, and contribute to efforts to offer support where it’s most needed.\r\n\r\nWe hypothesize that certain messaging will be perceived as helpful/unhelpful to people, based on their circumstances (e.g., geographic location, type of work) and goals (e.g., entering graduate school). In the event that certain messaging is interpreted to be helpful/unhelpful, this information will be useful moving forward during this pandemic and in the face of future crises. The higher education and STEM communities can use the findings from this study to better understand how individuals perceive the ways in which their academic/professional work is (or could be) impacted by COVID-19. Additionally, this study will explore the ways in which individuals tap into the knowledge they’ve gained as members of certain cultural/community groups during the COVID-19 crisis.\r\n\r\nIndividuals must be 18 or older to take the survey. All undergraduates, prospective graduate students, graduate students, and professionals in STEM fields and/or disciplines are welcome.

Here, we’ll come together -- virtually, of course -- from all over the country to research various components of the coronavirus pandemic in hopes of helping and informing others. \r\n\r\nThe event will last from 2:00pm to 5:00pm EST, with one hour volunteer time slots available. If you’ve got more time, we’d love for you to stick around all day!  Ballotpedia will be opening up a Slack channel where we will propose projects, answer questions, share what we’re listening to on Spotify, and just generally connect with each other in this uncertain time. At 5:15pm EST, we’ll be hosting a virtual Happy Hour over Zoom to have some fun and thank you for your contributions.  You can register for the Day of Service right here: https://bit.ly/2xwKQgz  \r\n\r\nI want this opportunity to work for you, so if you can’t make our official volunteer event day, no problem! I can set you up with a self-paced opportunity and you can contribute to our spreadsheet of coronavirus updates on your own time.

Although wide range of testing is available and increasing daily, no large scale service exists that easily proves a person’s test results to others.

      "description":"Please see our Github page! https://github.com/checkuponme/info\r\n\r\nWe’ve entered into these strange times where self quarantining alone and making sure you don’t leave the house without your mask and gloves has become the norm. Unfortunately what’s also starting to turn normal is the fear and anxiety that many people experience dealing with these situations that we’re now facing every single day.\r\n\r\nThe sad truth is, we have this rather large population of people who are much more susceptible to COVID-19 and the risk to them if they contract it is life threatening. Asthmatics, people with immune disorders, the elderly and even just people who are just badly out of shape. \r\n\r\nFor this large but limited set of the global population, doing simple things that we all take for granted like getting groceries or getting the mail is now much more dangerous. On top of that, many people may not be fortunate enough to have others to rely on so they have no other choice but to take the risk in order to survive... Imagine that… Risking your life so you can get groceries.\r\n\r\nThat’s a situation that I don’t think anyone should ever have to be put in. That is the problem that we’re solving with CheckUpOn.me.\r\n\r\nCheckUpOn.Me provides a peer-to-peer message and outreach platform for creating connections between volunteers, public safety professionals and people in need. During the COVID-19 pandemic our goal is to help where it's needed most by connecting people in need with volunteers and professionals who will be ready to take action. \r\n\r\nOur solution is built on top of the Open Source React and NodeJS project called Spoke. Spoke is an application that facilitates texting between end users and volunteers and is most well known for being used by grassroots political campaigns in the USA such as the Bernie Sanders Campaign and Elizabeth Warren Campaign for facilitating voter outreach.\r\n\r\nCheckUpOn.Me is part of the Reach4Help.org family. There are a large number of organizations struggling with certain logistics, such as coordinating their volunteer workforce, prioritizing the most urgent requests, and ensuring that all requests get fulfilled. Reach4Help.org is an open project that aims to address these issues, by enabling those in need to receive help and enabling partner groups and organizations to help more efficiently by mobilizing their volunteers with the help of Reach4Helps relief management platform. \r\n\r\n--- Where can I learn more?\r\n\r\nYou can learn more about CheckUpOn.Me here: https://github.com/checkuponme/info.\r\n\r\nYou can learn more about Reach4Help here: https://github.com/reach4help/reach4help.\r\n\r\n--- What's next for CheckUpOn.Me\r\n\r\nWhile our current goal is to support the fight against COVID-19, our end goal is to help enable virtual civic collaboration for creating the cure for significant systemic risks to which adequate public and private solutions don't exist by rapidly creating and spreading a global, community driven, open source solution. \r\n\r\n--- In closing...\r\n\r\nI want to thank everyone for participating in all of these recent COVID-19 relief focused hackathons and maker festivals. It’s truly been a moving experience in some really dark times.",

One theme will likely be noise pollution, i.e. how the current lack of noise shows how noisy we usually are and create better awareness of the impact humans have on the planet.\r\n\r\nWhy is this important? It's because we live in the so-called Anthropocene, the first geological epoch in the history of this planet that's dominated by the effects of the activity of just one species: Humans. Many aspects of the Anthropocene have been discussed and reported on, among them plastic pollution and climate change. But very few projects focus on what the human presence on this planet means for its soundscapes. \r\n\r\nThat's where this project comes in.

      "description":"In the last point-in-time count, conducted on January 24, 2019, there were 9,784 people living unhoused in San Francisco.  We expect that this number will rise in the coming months, as shelters close and people lose their incomes and deplete their savings.  Our project aims to safely isolate and shelter these folks, as quickly as possible, in three steps: \r\n\r\n1. We are soliciting donations for tents and sleeping bags.  People can buy new tents and sleeping bags online, have them shipped to a donation site, and notify us of their donation through this google form:\r\nhttps://forms.gle/dqXVvZpPyL5AH9ps5\r\n\r\n2. Several groups (Coalition on Homelessness , Homeless Youth Alliance , and Faithful Fools) are working together to coordinate immediate and contactless distribution of these supplies.\r\n\r\n3. We are working with the SFPD to designate safe, approved locations for multiple encampments so that 1) shelters will not be removed or confiscated by the police, and 2) services may be administered safely and efficiently.  \r\n\r\n\r\n*** FAQ ***\r\nQ:  How many tents are needed?  \r\nUnfortunately, we are beginning at a disadvantage.  Many tents have been pulled off the streets and confiscated after the city’s policy of conducting “sweeps” in 2019 [1].  At the end of 2019, only 649 tents and 814 vehicles in the city were being used as shelter [2].  A back-of-the-envelope calculation shows that roughly 8,300 (or 85%) of our unhoused neighbors will require shelter, but we expect this number to grow in the coming months. \r\n\r\nQ:  What is the situation with shelters? \r\nSome shelters have closed down entirely and are no longer providing services.

What do you people think?\r\n\r\n1)\r\nAverage temperature at which viruses gets wiped is around 60°C according to this link\r\npage 247, \r\nTable 1., \r\nhttps://www.journalofhospitalinfection.com/article/S0195-6701(20)30046-3/pdf\r\n\r\nplus I spoke with Scientist (described below)\r\n\r\n2)\r\nSo I thought to myself, nothing but to light a candle for hope. \r\nThen it struck me:\r\n\"I wonder, how much a tealight candle burns oxygen in one run\".\r\nAnd googled googled and stumbled upon reddit post:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/oc0l3/how_much_oxygen_does_a_candle_use_in_a_closed_room/\r\n\r\nSomebody (nickname Diracdeltafunct) calculated 8 years ago\r\nhat in a room 3x3x2.5m\r\nin one run of a Tealight\r\nabout \r\n2% \r\nof O2 in that room is burned. \r\n\r\nSo I decided to ask people, who have more scientific experimental approach or and knowledge, refer to that this project :) Thank you.\r\n\r\n( In particular: 2% burn rate is just oxygen, what about general dynamics of an airflow etc., actual probability, because I used it as an probability, could be higher, Let me know what do you think ).\r\n\r\nConsidering the fact that a flame is between 300°C - 1000°C.\r\n\r\nI added :\r\n1+2=\r\n3)\r\nIf I put 5 tealights, then\r\nI increase the chance by 10% of the airflow going through that fire, and thus burning COVID-9 with Holy Fire.\r\n\r\nBonus 4)\r\nAs O2 is used, it creates some sort of vacuum, thus directing the airflow through the candle (correct me if I'm wrong)\r\n\r\n[edit] : Correction, I spoke with Dr of Chemistry (name undisclosed), who replied with this, let me quote conversation I had with him:\r\n \r\n- I suppose it really comes down to how much airflow you can direct near the candle\r\n- True, thus positioning is important. what about those temperatures? because i am no sciemcist.\r\n- Yeah, most viruses pop around 60 C. Most viruses are incredibly fragile. Dry them out or hit them with elevated temperatures and they just kinda pop like a tightly packaged hand grenade.\r\n- ...and there is airflow towards fire , correct?\r\n- Yeah, it should create a little zone of high pressure the moves air up and pulls it in from the sides.\r\n- So, its worth sharing this post i think ( [ref.]: what you are reading here), up for discussion. Just't don't know where.\r\n- Yeah, I have no idea either. The only problem with tea lights (other than the fire hazard) is the particulates that they give off when burning; could make asthma worse\r\n\r\n\r\nBonus 5)\r\nRest of calculation we can figure from this post more or less.\r\nAlso, it's good to position the candles in some \"smart\" way in \"fragile\" places.\r\n\r\nPoint is: \r\nTealights are \"relatively\" low cost and could increase the chance of air (and virus) going through fire. Worth trying.\r\n\r\nLight up the candles people and burn this with Holy Fire!!!\r\n\r\nThat's what I would do at this moment at least In Italy, China, Iran, Spain and across the Globe.\r\nAnd of course in my beloved Poland.\r\n\r\nPS.1 Information here Initially Confirmed by acquaintance of mine who happens to be Dr of Chemistry, working with bacteria and viruses, Super Lab Nerd (24/7 more or less in a lab). Soon will have more update on that.\r\n\r\nPS.2 Be careful.\r\n\r\nPS.3. I have an idea for a project / experiment, made some README.md on github, here: \r\nhttps://github.com/tpawel/ceo",

      "description":"At this point (March 19), grocery stores are probably the most prolific place for the virus to spread: It's the only place where people still congregate in the hundreds at a given time (especially because everybody is buying more groceries than ever before), and there are obvious lapses in hygiene that will make the current shelter-in-place orders completely ineffective. E.g., at stores in the bay area such as Costco, Safeway, Whole Foods, etc, cashiers don't wear masks, don't disinfect their hands/gloves after every interaction where they touch groceries or cash individual customers have touched, and don't sanitize the credit card key pad or conveyor belt. This means if one customer or the cashier carry the virus and spread it onto a food item, the conveyor belt, the cash, or the key pad, it can spread to hundreds of customers in a straightforward manner. I suggest setting up a fund where donations can be collected to pay grocery workers adequately as emergency responders while training them (either in person or through online tutorials) to curb this spreading mechanism. It's probably as important as staffing hospitals and manufacturing more ventilators for turning this pandemic around right now. ",

We need to create a new social norm.\r\n \r\nLet's take advantage of the fact that Americans LOVE sports and games. So many people don't understand why they are being asked to temporarily suspend their personal freedoms as they self-quarantine/shelter in place. It's so anti-American to make that sacrifice.\r\n \r\nBut guess what? This app shows you how many lives you save every second on your Quarantine Clock. A person in Raleigh knows that at 3 days 11 hr 4 min 33 sec she have saved 4,755 lives! That feels so great! The app links up with your friends and family so you can virtually cheer each other on and feel like superheroes saving lives. You can chat and share photos! When you go out alone for weekly groceries with precautions, you can brag about how few people you interacted with and how far away you stood. Who washed their hands the most? It can visually show how our collective actions bend and flatten the curve too! There could potentially even be a financial incentive for every moment someone must self-quarantine. They deserve it for saving lives!\r\n \r\nLet's help people feel positive and connected about doing the right thing and give them a sense of control. Please take this idea and run with it.

The content is collected from non-profit strategic partners that are funded by the users of the game. The goal is to visualize the created impact on the individual user’s level so that everyone can be encouraged to donate more as \"one drop in the ocean also matters a lot\".

      "description":"USE EXISTING BIPAP MACHINES TO SAVE LIVES\r\n\r\nRead this before continuing if you haven't, it's very good: \r\n\r\nhttps://medium.com/@joschabach/flattening-the-curve-is-a-deadly-delusion-eea324fe9727\r\n\r\nWe have a maximum of 200k ventilators in hospitals. In the hospital, more than 50 percent of patients are intubated. Those who don't need intubation are on a noninvasive ventilator with oxygen, usually 4 weeks. This means that in pretty much all scenarios, hundreds of thousands of Americans will die for lack of access to a ventilator, not to mention for lack of access to hospital resources. \r\n\r\nHowever, there are hundreds of thousands of biPAP machines, and most of them can feed oxygen. And you can buy a machine that makes oxygen, rather than get a tank delivered. This can be done at home with a prescription if you have someone to manage the tech. In addition to BiPAP, CPAP may be able to help a lot of people, and there are millions of CPAP machines available. Certainly, some people will die at home this way, but they would more certainly die without getting hospital resources. \r\n\r\nSo the idea is to sell a kit to cash-paying customers, send them the equipment and use telemedicine to care for them and help them self-survive. It would be like $20k, includes 3 months of online support. Cost would be less than half that. Many of the pieces are in place, but the reality is that the fit of the mask is key and the staff to be on the other end of the Skype call doesn't exist right now. The people who have supported snorers with their masks have never seen a patient die or had to call the police because the patient wasn't answering the video call in the morning. It sucks, but it could save x - x00,000 lives, depending on the scenario. \r\n\r\nYou need clear step-by-step instructions. You need to understand whether the person putting it together is infected or immune or uninfected. Possible that groups of patients could help each other (this is a good general concept that could be explored further). Need to make checklists. Need to make a poster of what to do in which situations. \r\n\r\nThis is not my business, but I've started 20 companies and know enough people to put this together using existing online CPAP stores, Manila-based medical call centers, and a good web site plus PR. It would be grueling, but I need my next venture and would be willing to try (from home). \r\n\r\nI could try to whip up some numbers. They would be wrong, but they may prove useful. \r\n\r\nFrom there, once the crisis is over, the company is in a medical supply business for prescription durable goods that could potentially outcompete the existing companies and go on to be acquired by Amazon. I would find a CEO for it. Or we could just do it as a pop-up or a nonprofit and shut it down. The insurance liability and waiver issues would be significant, but death is also significant. \r\n\r\nHave to educate doctors that there is this option, but they will understand it right away and may recommend for milder or younger patients. Need good PR and social media to get the word out. \r\n\r\nFor $20k cash, many upmarket families might just buy the kit and have it on-hand for grandma, even if they don't need it. The weakest link is the online support, but I do have an edge there. \r\n\r\nI don't know if I could get this up and running in 60 days, but I could try. I would need a commitment of $3 million, so I can try to get service contracts in place, put up a site, create legal documents. Then probably need more once it's launched. I would need to move fast and break things. Everyone work remotely and use available resources rather than reinvent anything. I've done that before. \r\n\r\nIn probably half of all scenarios, this is a serious life saver using machines we have in the US already. ",

      "description":"This concept ultimately concerns a way to make indoor environments “pandemic safe”, preferably under a yet non-existent certification or “seal of approval” system.  \r\n\r\nI will begin this presentation with a discussion of the existence of virucidal coatings in the perspective of their original intent; their application on various surfaces in the environment.  I will also be discussing the types of handles that are encountered in the environment, with a focus on their design.  Handles are the most predominant, likely-to-be-touched objects in the everyday, public environment.  Also, further below I will provide information concerning potential approaches for fighting the airborne transmission of Covid-19.  \r\n\r\nFollowing the overview discussions on surfaces, handles and devices to help prevent the transmission of airborne Covid-19, I will get to the ultimate goal of this narrative:  developing a mechanism for promoting  their use within buildings and elsewhere.  It is hoped that the above-mentioned applications will become commonplace in the indoor environment.  \r\nAlthough the attainment of a heavily protected environment may not be possible during our encounter with Covid-19 in 2020, we might be able to attain the goal in later years prior to the commencement of another pandemic, perhaps helping to keeping it from getting a foothold in the first place.\r\n\r\nLet’s begin with information on virucidal surfaces.    \r\n \r\nIn the current situation with Covid-19, it has become difficult for people to buy hand cleansers and multiple gloves to carry along with them. Thus, when people go to work or shop and conduct other daily activities, there is a high probability that their hands will come into contact with virus laden surfaces and thus transfer the viruses to other surfaces (or themselves). \r\nKeeping this in mind, the reader is invited to examine the links (below) which my casual research uncovered. As you will see, they discuss the invention by various entities of coatings for use on various items (handrails, medical equipment, etc.), which can essentially kill viruses on contact, or at least within a very short period of time. Other coatings of a similar nature exist or are currently being developed.\r\n\r\nhttps://www.thehindubusinessline.com/news/science/virucidal-coating-to-prevent-covid-19-transmission/article31411777.ece\r\n\r\nhttps://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/04/090420121425.htm\r\n\r\nhttps://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2019/08/190801142534.htm\r\n\r\nhttps://www.biospace.com/article/releases/epa-approved-antimicrobial-surface-coating-represents-breakthrough-in-the-control-and-spread-of-infectious-diseases/\r\n\r\nhttps://www.omicsonline.org/open-access/effectiveness-of-nanomaterial-copper-cold-spray-surfaces-on-inactivationof-influenza-a-virus-2155-952X-1000205.php?aid=64558\r\n\r\nhttps://patents.google.com/patent/WO2008127416A2/en\r\n\r\nhttps://www.wral.com/lifestyles/healthteam/video/1108435/\r\n\r\nhttps://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2018/RA/C8RA01985A#!divAbstract\r\n\r\nhttps://www.biocote.com/blog/5-benefits-antimicrobial-paint/\r\n\r\nhttps://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/1044961\r\n\r\nhttps://www.nanowerk.com/news/newsid=13045.php\r\n\r\nhttps://aabme.asme.org/posts/special-surface-coating-can-kill-most-bacteria-and-viruses-on-contact\r\n\r\nhttps://www.pnas.org/content/103/47/17667  \r\n\r\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1693804/ \r\n\r\nhttps://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/antibacterial-coating \r\n\r\nhttps://physicsworld.com/a/antimicrobial-coating-kills-multi-resistant-pathogens-on-the-iss/\r\n\r\nhttps://bmcmicrobiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12866-016-0675-x\r\n\r\nhttps://www.researchgate.net/publication/6695607_Polymeric_coatings_that_inactivate_both_influenza_virus_and_pathogenic_bacteria\r\n\r\nhttps://www.scientificamerican.com/article/paint-on-polymer-kills-fl/\r\n\r\nhttps://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2018/ra/c8ra01985a#!divAbstract\r\n\r\nhttps://www.manchester.ac.uk/discover/news/unique-new-antiviral-treatment-made-using-sugar/ \r\n\r\nhttps://www.aithority.com/ait-featured-posts/opinion-young-jamaicans-invention-could-help-tackle-spread-of-viruses-like-covid-19/\r\n\r\nAlthough I have presented a concept in another narrative proposing the development of a glove with virucidal characteristics, the eventual coating of likely touched surfaces would augment the work of any gloves.  If virucidal gloves are not developed, the coating of likely touched surfaces would still make a significant impact.\r\n\r\nAs an aside, it might not be possible to coat touch screens.  In those cases, a stylus with a virucidal coating hanging nearby would circumvent this problem.  \r\n\r\nThe key take away from the preceding is that surfaces for use in the public realm can be manufactured with virucidal properties or products can have virucidal coatings added to them.\r\n\r\nSomewhat related to the topic of surfaces is the matter of handles.  Handles are a major item that people can be expected to touch in the public realm.  They are found everywhere, such as with the following:  building entrance and room doors; grocery store freezer / refrigerator doors; office refrigerator doors; rest room doors; drop box handles, sink handles; toilet handles; cabinet handles; and so forth.  The handles (or knobs) come in various types, as shown here:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Door_handle ; https://www.thespruce.com/select-correct-door-hardware-4125753          As stated in these links and discoverable in a basic internet search, the available types are:  lever; pull (”U” shaped); door knob (round); and handset (thumb is used).  Also used on doors are emergency push bars and flat push panels.  \r\n\r\nVarious types of add-on or stand-alone devices have been made for use on lever and pull handles to enable use without the need of a hand grasp.  Thus, there is less of a chance of contact transmission.  Examples are shown here:  https://www.dezeen.com/2020/03/25/hands-free-door-handle-coronavirus-ivo-tedbury-freddie-hong/ ; https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-52008745 ; \r\nhttps://www.materialise.com/en/hands-free-door-opener\r\nhttps://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/knock-knock-no-more-doors-are-being-redesigned-amid-covid-n1206021\r\nhttps://www.vmsd.com/content/covid-19-hands-free-door-handle\r\nhttps://www.lbbonline.com/news/this-hands-free-door-handle-is-helping-fight-the-covid-19-pandemic\r\nhttp://theleadsouthaustralia.com.au/industries/manufacturing/no-hands-door-handles-open-new-markets/\r\nhttps://fireco.uk/dorgard-smartsound-can-assist-with-germ-control/?utm_content=buffer8539f\u0026utm_medium=social\u0026utm_source=twitter.com\u0026utm_campaign=buffer\r\nhttps://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/sanitgrasp--the-public-hands-free-door-handle---is-exploding-in-sales-301026958.html\r\n\r\nIt should be noted that the add-on-devices could quite feasibly be incorporated into solid (“one piece”) designs from manufacturers.  Regarding door knobs and handsets, it does not appear that anyone has come up with an approach to make them infection-prevention-friendly.  The owners of buildings with such handles may prefer to keep them for aesthetic reasons, but be open to add-on adaptations during a pandemic.  Door knobs could probably be addressed by a rubber-coated vice-like component to encircle the knob (locked into place) and attaching a lever/armrest in a manner similar to what is shown in some of the preceding links.  Handsets could possibly be addressed with a lever positioned above the thumb receptacle which could be pulled forward with a forearm.  This movement would cause a piece of the lever to depress the thumb receptacle.  These are just rough outlines, I am certain someone could bring something like these concepts into existence.   \r\n\r\nIn view of the preceding, we have options for making a major source of contact transmission in the environment safer for users.     \r\n\r\nNext, regarding a way to reduce the airborne transmission of Covid-19, there is the option of negative ion generators.  In a nutshell, negative ions weigh down any particulates in the air (including microorganisms) and cause them to fall to the ground.  Furthermore, there is research which indicates that negative ions can kill viruses outright.  If the negative ions from negative ion generators can indeed have these effects, they have great potential for limiting the exposure of people in buildings to any airborne Covid-19 in the area.  \r\n\r\nThe following are some pertinent links which explain the capabilities of negative ions:  \r\n\r\nSuccessful study with viruses:  https://www.nature.com/articles/srep11431 \r\n\r\nIonizer destroys acinobacter in hospital:  https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn3228-air-ionisers-wipe-out-hospital-infections/ \r\n\r\nAn aircraft ionization system:  https://www.ainonline.com/aviation-news/business-aviation/2015-10-09/ionization-system-removes-pathogens-cabin-air\r\n\r\nActive against Salmonella:  https://agresearchmag.ars.usda.gov/2000/mar/salm\r\n\r\nA listing of studies compiled by a manufacturer:  https://www.surroundair.com/negative-ions/\r\n\r\nEffective against Newcastle virus:  https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2130090/pdf/jhyg00043-0066.pdf  \r\n\r\nEffective with viruses:\r\nhttps://www.researchgate.net/publication/279065550_Ionizing_air_affects_influenza_virus_infectivity_and_prevents_airborne-transmission\r\n\r\nhttps://lynnemctaggart.com/getting-rid-of-the-corona-virus-with-thin-air/\r\n\r\nRole with antibody treatment:\r\nhttps://www.fortuneindia.com/ideas/new-treatment-may-cure-covid-19-in-48-hours/104485\r\n\r\nUse in hospitals:\r\nhttps://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/hospitals-to-get-negative-ion-generators-to-fight-covid-19/articleshow/74902482.cms\r\n\r\nExample of Bipolar ionization:\r\nhttps://www.traveltechtoday.com/2020/03/05/connecticut-company-put-positive-negative-ions-to-work-against-coronavirus/\r\n\r\nPlasmacluster ions – effective against viruses:  \r\nhttps://phys.org/news/2004-07-inactivate-airborne-virus-withplasma.html\r\nhttps://global.sharp/pci/en/certified/pdf/viruses_01.pdf\r\n\r\nA few available products:\r\nhttps://www.lightair.com/the-virus-prevention-invention/\r\nhttps://www.greenlodgingnews.com/connecticut-company-put-ions-to-work-against-coronavirus/\r\n\r\nSupport in Scotland:  \r\nhttps://www.thenational.scot/news/18351414.coronavirus-ionisers-may-key-fight-defeat-covid-19/\r\n\r\nNonthermal Plasma Reactor (Cold Plasma) – an advancec negative ion generator – Effective against viruses:  \r\nhttps://www.agweb.com/article/can-nonthermal-plasma-inactivate-airborne-viral-threat-pigs\r\n\r\nThis discusses only ozone:  http://www.china.org.cn/opinion/2020-02/26/content_75747237_4.htm ; https://www.ozonepartner.com/poultry \r\n\r\nThus, negative ion generators could likely have a predominant role in establishing an extremely safe public environment.\r\n\r\nAn additional approach to reduce the airborne transmission of Covid 19 involves the application of UVC light and/or Far UVC light.   Both have strong virucidal properties.   \r\n\r\nUVC light has been used for many years to eradicate microorganisms from the air of buildings.  Units are usually installed within ductwork, or on walls at least seven feet from the ground with shielding to prevent eye damage to people nearby (this is termed “upper air irradiation”).   The wall unit lights point outward at an angle and upward, often towards a ceiling air vent.  The following describes these type of arrangements:  https://www.achrnews.com/articles/141736-how-hvac-can-help-prevent-the-spread-of-contagious-diseases  .  A problem with UVC light is that it can harm humans.\r\n\r\nI have outlined elsewhere how UVC light can be expanded beyond the above, traditional applications within an indoors setting.  I have also written elsewhere how Far UVC light, which will not harm humans and is relatively new to the scene, could also find a wide variety of applications in an indoor environment.  \r\n\r\nThe following provides insights on UVC:    https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20200325-covid-19-the-history-of-pandemics ;    https://www.digitaltrends.com/news/can-uv-light-kill-coronavirus/ ;  https://www.rfsafe.com/207-222-nm-uvc-light-can-slow-spread-of-novel-coronavirus-covid-19/ ; https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-21058-w  .  This suggests the Far-UVC can be emitted by LED:  https://www.news.ucsb.edu/2020/019860/power-light ; https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/uvglo-the-world-s-smartest-uv-c-led-sterilizer#/ ;  \r\n\r\nNow that we have an understanding of the tools which are available for use in indoor environments, we need to discuss how their use can be expanded.\r\n\r\nWe can begin by noting that despite their abilities, none of these approaches have been utilized to any significant extent.  The key environmental changes that have taken place thus far are the following:  (1) staff members performing consistent cleaning (i.e. shopping cart handles); (2) markings and directional indicators on floors to help with social distancing; (3) plexiglass barriers at cash registers; (4) separate entrances and exits;(5) limitations on the number of people to enter; (6) social distancing; and (7) mandatory mask wearing by entrants.  Actually, #1- #3 are the only concepts which can be seen as involving a true environmental change of some sort.  Thus, with all of the tools at our disposal, no changes of a truly environmental nature (surfaces, air) have been incorporated.  The plexiglass might qualify, but it does nothing for everyone else in line.  This all sets us up for potential failure, as in a resurgence of Covid-19.  \r\n\r\nIn order to move along in a more proactive manner, I propose that the Federal government (or individual state governments) and/or private industry come up with some guidelines or “understandings” of what would constitute an extremely safe indoor environment.  It is proposed that if specific indoor environments comply with certain parameters, they would qualify for a special seal or certification which could be publicly displayed.  This would effectively allow them to operate in a “business as usual” mode for the remainder of Covid-19’s presence, or at the outset of any future pandemic.  It would be in a public entity’s financial or public image benefit to obtain such a seal or certification.  The only caveat in such situations is that they, and non-certified entities, might be required to have building entrants (customers, vendors, employees) wear certain items to gain entry (i.e., masks, sneeze catchers, virucidal gloves, negative ion headsets, etc.).  Such requirements by government or a private entity will not have a bearing on this seal/certification program.  \r\n\r\nI will refer from this point on to this certifying body as a “Consortium.”  It could involve either the government, a private group, or both working together.  \r\n\r\nThe Consortium would need to establish standards of what would qualify as a truly safe indoor environment.  For example, it could address:  (1) Whether or not door (or other) handles which do not require hand use are installed; (2) Whether or not virucidal coatings are applied to all likely surfaces to be touched, such as door handles, countertops (where customers wait), card readers, thermostats, light switches, gas pump handles, shopping cart handles, door surfaces from waist to chest high (particularly in rest rooms), key pads, stylus devices for signing on a screen, table tops, parts of chairs, the containers used when going through a metal detector to hold metallic items, escalator “handles”, cash registers, line barriers (velvet rope devices), bank drive-in pneumatic tube canisters, rest room sink handles, broom handles, water fountains, product scanners,  etc.; (3) Whether or not negative ion generators, UVC light, Far UVC light or negative air flow (not discussed previously), alone (excluding negative air flow) or in combination, has been established at a level of intensity, with proper spacing, which would truly clean the air; (4) Whether or not additional devices not focused upon here (i.e., plexiglass) have been installed.  \r\n\r\nOnce standards are established and an entity passes an inspection, they would be certified and obtain all the privileges, mainly public gratitude and respect, which would come with it.  Customers would be more likely to patronize such a setting and employees would have greater morale.  \r\n\r\nConcurrent with the preceding would be a similar understanding with manufacturers of the types of items that would be used indoors, as discussed above.  Here, the actual items or products would receive a certification.\r\n\r\nAny certified entity would be subject to surprise, unannounced visits to confirm their continuing compliance.  \r\n\r\nAlthough the certification concept has focused on indoor environments and the special devices which would be used in such settings to reduce the risk of infection, a similar approach, involving only items suitable for virucidal coatings and commonly owned by individuals, could be pursued.  The primary beneficiary would be individuals, in the form of their health.  Some of the items of interest can commonly be seen brandished in indoor public settings, such as cell phones, credit cards, wallets/purses, and house/car keys.  There should be a focus on these, because these are the items which a person will bring back home from the public settings they have visited.  Then you have other things such as:  car door handles (and various parts of car interiors), home mailboxes, door handles for consumer (home) use, food holders for work lunches and so forth.  Again, such items would need to be reviewed by the Consortium before they can use a certification seal.    \r\n\r\nAssuming that businesses, schools, stores, etc. are supportive of the concept, the matter of cost raises its head.  One would think that the negative ion generators and light systems would be the most costly.  Perhaps their manufacture and ready availability could be subsidized by the Federal government, in lieu of infrastructure spending which has often been discussed.  Or, the devices could somehow be made available at cost.  This is the aspect of the idea which presents the greatest burden.  What would help would be studies by an impartial outside entity to determine what the true cost of a protective product is and what percentage would go beyond a reasonable profit into price gouging.  It might be that the best product in one of the above-mentioned categories has a patent and, as a result, the manufacturer has an upper hand with regards to pricing.  It should be impressed upon them that the establishment of a Consortium could bring them customers at a level far beyond what they could have expected otherwise.  Perhaps that awareness could encourage them to be more open towards lower pricing.\r\n\r\nTax deductions for use of these devices could be considered.  Or perhaps the Defense Production Act could come into play.    \r\n\r\nIt is hoped that someone would be able to arrive at a proper solution concerning any price roadblocks.  \r\n\r\nAlthough not focused upon here, consideration should be given for requiring the above-discussed preventive measures be in place before future construction permits (for new commercial buildings) or business occupancy licenses are granted.  \r\n\r\nIf a Consortium can be formed and a consensus reached on the various points as discussed above, we may start to see the gradual formation of indoor environments used by the public to acquire a considerable degree of protection from Covid-19 (if things are expedited) and any future pandemic.  This, in turn, could greatly lower the need for any future shutdowns of the economy.   ",

      "description":"If a person has contracted Covid-19, it would be ideal if a person’s body could fight it off and not progress to a severe illness.  The body relies heavily on the thymus in this regard.  \r\n\r\nThe thymus has a major role in the immune system.  However, as a person ages, it gradually decreases in size, contributing to the difficulty which older people have in fighting off infections.  Furthermore, its status of a defender against infections is significantly impaired if a person had contracted CMV (Cytomegalovirus) at some point during their life.  Unfortunately, the majority of the population fits into that boat.  \r\n\r\nThe following links discuss the tremendous damage which CMV does to the thymus and how, as a result, the body’s defense against infections, (which would logically include  Covid-19), is significantly weakened.  \r\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2752092/\r\nhttps://www.intechopen.com/books/manifestations-of-cytomegalovirus-infection/the-footprint-of-cmv-infection-may-last-a-lifetime\r\nhttps://www.jci.org/articles/view/40855/figure/2\r\nhttps://medcraveonline.com/MOJAP/aging-of-thymus-gland-and-immune-system.html\r\nhttps://www.omicsonline.org/widespread-outbreaks-of-a-subtle-condition-leading-to-hospitalisation-and-death-2161-1165.1000137.php?aid=20306\r\nAnd a contrarian article:  https://www.fightaging.org/archives/2018/07/arguing-that-cytomegalovirus-is-beneficial-for-old-immune-systems/\r\n\r\nThe instinctive action to take with CMV is to develop a vaccine against it.  Such efforts are in the works, but nothing has been finalized yet.  See the following:   https://thenativeantigencompany.com/where-are-we-at-with-cmv-vaccine-development/ ; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X18302883 ;   https://investors.modernatx.com/news-releases/news-release-details/moderna-completes-enrollment-cytomegalovirus-cmv-vaccine-mrna ; https://www.contagionlive.com/news/cytomegalovirus-vaccine-candidate-found-to-be-safe-and-immunogenic-in-first-in-humans-trial ; https://themedicinemaker.com/discovery-development/the-bumpy-road-to-a-cytomegalovirus-vaccine \r\n\r\nIf a CMV vaccine came on the market today, it would not make much of an impact on Covid-19 in 2020.  But the sooner one is developed, the sooner people in the future will be able to obtain protection and, as a result, maintain their thymus function at a higher level than would a person who had become infected at some point.   Therefore, when the next pandemic comes around, a larger number of people in the general population will have significantly stronger immune systems to fight off an infection if they had the opportunity to receive a CMV vaccine..\r\n\r\nIn light of the strong, indirect effect which a CMV vaccine would have in future pandemics, I propose the following:  (1) Research whether or not there are other infectious organisms which can cause the degree of damage which CMV does and if any, its degree of prevalence in the population; (2) Conduct labwork on current hospitalized Covid-19 patients with respect to their CMV (or other organism) status; (3) Have the Federal government devote a significant amount of resources toward a vaccine against CMV; (4)  Once a vaccine is available, perform an intense campaign for people to get vaccinated.\r\n\r\nAgain, this will not have any current effect against Covid-19, but it should pay us back in the next pandemic with fewer severe cases.\r\n",

      "description":"If a person has contracted Covid-19, it would be ideal if a person’s body could fight it off and not progress to a severe illness.  There can be a number of factors that may help or hinder the body in vanquishing it quickly, among them:  genetics; the presence or absence of other illnesses (i.e., diabetes, heart disease, etc.); whether or not a vaccine had been previously injected; and age.  Genetics can’t be changed, co-existing illnesses will not disappear overnight; a vaccine is not here yet; and age cannot be reversed …. or can it?\r\n\r\nThe thymus has a major role in the immune system and fighting off infections.  However, as a person ages, it gradually decreases in size, contributing to the difficulty which older people have in fighting off infections.  If it had remained at greater strength over the decades, elderly people would fare well.  Since Covid-19 hits elderly people quite hard, it makes one wonder how it would be if the elderly had retained a healthy thymus.  We may have an answer to this in the coming years.  \r\n\r\nIn noting the importance of the thymus in fighting off infections, it is interesting to find that a number of scientists are already making progress towards the goal of actually regenerating the thymus, as the following links reveal:\r\nhttps://www.the-scientist.com/daily-news/researchers-develop-a-technique-to-regenerate-the-mouse-thymus-30421\r\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4837659/\r\nhttps://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12015-020-09955-y\r\nhttps://www.researchgate.net/publication/338908647_Thymus_Regeneration_and_Future_Challenges\r\nhttps://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-02638-w \r\n\r\nObviously, it is very unlikely that a fully tested and approved method of thymus regeneration will become available in 2020 or even the following year.  If, by some miracle, an approved method was on hand, it could be of tremendous benefit in protecting the elderly who had not yet been infected.  \r\n\r\nOf course, the hunt for a vaccine or outright cure will be everyone’s focus while Covid-19 remains a threat.  But we should start giving serious thought to devoting a large proportion of resources to thymus regeneration, to be prepared for the next time a pandemic takes place.  Although no one can predict when that will be, know this:  America’s enemies have seen what Covid-19 has done to our economy and cannot be excluded from considering the surreptitious launch of an “accident” along these lines in the future.  Should thymus regeneration already be perfected, our chances of weathering another pandemic will be dramatically improved.  \r\n\r\nI therefore urge that consideration be given to having the Federal government place a major focus of funding thymus regeneration research and accelerating its path to implementation. \r\n\r\nIn addition, I would urge that studies commence now with hospitalized Covid-19 patients to evaluate their thymus function and compare it to the degree of their recovery.  The findings will likely boost the case for devoting a significant amount of resources to thymus regeneration.  \r\n",

      "name":"Mobile strategies to counter airborne Covid-19",
      "description":"In considering current options to protect against the indoor airborne transmission of Covid-19, in settings where people regularly transit, the current available options are:  (1) Masks or respirators (being commonly used); (2) Stationary placements of negative ion generators; UVC light or Far UVC light (none of which have yet become commonplace); and (3) Personal (wearable) devices emitting negative ions and/or Far UVC light (only a less-refined version available, in minimal use).  \r\n\r\nThe varied concepts in this narrative puts forth strategies to expand the indoor use of negative ions, UVC light and Far UVC light in intensities much greater than would be possible in personal wearable devices (#3, above), thus providing wider protective coverage.  Furthermore, these concepts will enable a greater focus on the “human level” environment, where some of the proposals for stationary placements (#2, above) may not be able address in a sufficient manner.  Also, if the approach of #2 is not implemented in various settings, the approaches in this narrative will at least allow a comparable level of protection, either in large areas of buildings (A and B , below) or in the immediately surrounding environments of individuals (C, D and  E, below).\r\n\r\nAs alluded to above, the use of negative ions, UVC light and Far UVC light can help substantially in the fight against airborne Covid-19.  Links at the end of this presentation provide evidence of this.  \r\n\r\nThe strategies being put forth fall into the following categories.  First, we have options which would have a very high output (similar to #2, above).  This would involve:  (A) Robotic (“Roomba”) roaming devices; and (B) Wall and/or ceiling mounted “rail” systems.  Next, we have options that would have a greater output than #3, above, but not as much as #2, above.  That would involve:  (C) Wheelchair mounted devices; (D) “IV pole / umbrella” devices; and (E) “Lap tray” devices.  The use of any of these devices, A – E, will depend upon the nature of any environment under consideration.  \r\n\r\nThe robotic (“Roomba”) device (A) would generally consist of a tall, roaming column supporting negative ion generators and/or UVC light and/or Far UVC light.  Ideally, the column should not take up much floor space, as a large footprint would interfere with people passing by.  But that would cause stability problems.  Therefore, there would need to be a track positioned high up on the walls in hallways and large rooms.  These tracks would allow carriages, connected by cable with the column, to move along them.  The column would be able to adjust the tension on the cables as it moves from halls to rooms, etc.  If a person tried to knock over a column, the cables would tighten and the column would remain stable.  Special provisions would be needed if a room has columns.  This system would likely not be suitable for entering rooms through doors.  Overall, this system would be suitable only in hallways, aisles and lobbies.  This system could emit negative ions in all settings.  If it had motion detection and body warmth detection capabilities, it would be able to emit shielded UVC light (which is harmful to humans) in the absence of any people.  For example, in a hallway, the UVC light would be pointed to the side walls, not down the hallway; it would not shine into open doorways or office windows.  It could illuminate areas below seven feet off the ground, an ability which is not allowed with unattended stationary UVC lights (unless they had sensors).  If a person comes into range, the motion and body heat detection abilities would cause the UVC light to turn off.  It could shine Far UVC light, in all directions, virtually anytime.  It could refrain from pointing UVC light directly at the end of a hallway.  In essence, this arrangement could perform constant “sweeps” of the indoor environment and reach places with greater intensity than possible with stationary devices.  \r\n\r\nCareful consideration would be needed for the placement of such devices.  Offices, big box stores, universities, airport concourses, some medical facilities and houses of worship would seem to be likely candidates.  Schools and other settings where attempts at vandalism are likely would probably not do well with this.\r\n\r\nWall and/or ceiling mounted “rail” systems (B) would bear some similarity to robotic “Roomba” devices, in that a tall column would deliver the same protective technologies as mentioned above (including human detection).  The distinction is that they would run on wall or ceiling mounted rails that keep the column close to a nearby wall at all times.  This would greatly inhibit any attempts at vandalism.  The drawback is that the path used by the columns would need to be kept clear at all times.  \r\n\r\nThis system would likely find suitable placement in school hallways, office hallways, the walls and possibly aisles of auditoriums, etc.\r\n\r\nWheelchairs (C ) and similar mobility aids would also provide a good platform for protection and would perform a valuable service in places like nursing homes, by supplementing, to a degree, any stationary protective devices they may have in place.  This approach would require the design of a battery-powered system which provides protection, does not present a safety hazard, is durable and will not interfere with a wheelchair user getting in or out of the wheelchair.  It would not carry UVC light emitters; only negative ions and/or Far UVC light would be supplied.  Various approaches to the design of the emitters could be entertained, but they would likely entail either being housed in “columns” rising up from the vicinity of the handles which people use to push wheelchairs, or from an overhead “umbrella”, supported by columns as just described.  Any design would need to take into account the need of wheelchairs to collapse inward for transport (on occasions) and the occasional need to carry a patient in a medical transport van.  \r\n\r\nConsideration should also be given to this type of system being used on mobility chairs and scooters.  Rolling walkers could also be considered.  \r\n\r\nThis system would give greater protection to people who may need to leave a nursing home for a physician’s appointment and then return.  It would also help wheelchair bound individuals in stores, office settings, etc.  \r\n\r\n“IV pole / umbrella” devices (D) would bear some similarity to the preceding discussion on wheelchairs.  These would be more suitable for ambulatory individuals, particularly those with pre-existing conditions that may make them more susceptible to getting Covid-19.  The protective emitters could be established along the length of the pole.  It might be possible to incorporate some type of “umbrella” arrangement at the top of the pole (allowing Far UVC light to shine downward), but consideration should be given as to whether that would cause any balance problems.  The design of a system should take into account occasions where it may need to be collapsed, such as when getting into a car.  This system would allow an ambulatory person to take protection wherever he goes and, in most cases, it can be used while the person is standing or sitting.  \r\n\r\nThis device would be of tremendous help to people who work in offices or where intensive physical labor is not required.  \r\n\r\nThe final option, “lap tray” devices (E), are similar to the two immediately preceding discussions in that they would not incorporate UVC light.  “Lap tray” devices would find their best applications in restaurants, theaters / auditoriums, “over bed” tables (for patients in hospital beds); airplanes and mass transit.  The commonality in each of these settings is that the user would be seated or in bed at an incline.  Although there would be subtle design differences, depending on the setting involved, the lap trays would emit negative ions upward.  Far UVC light would at least emit upwards and could emit towards the user, depending on their preference.  If the upward point light is an annoyance to the user, the light could be angled away a bit with a “Venetian blinds” type of adaptation.  The addition of an upward pointed air curtain, from the side and distal edges of the “lap tray” could be considered (creating an encasing, three-sided wall), but the mechanics or air curtains will not be elaborated upon here.  \r\n\r\nThe components of the “lap tray” as mentioned above should provide an extra protective environment for the user.  However, various considerations need to be taken into account.  These concern whether or not the chair being used has arm rests and whether or not a table is in front of the user.  This leads to the following possibilities:  (1) A chair with armrests and no table (movie seat, airplane seat); (2) A chair with armrests and a table (some chairs in restaurants, chairs in front of desks in some offices); (3) A chair without armrests and no table (seats on buses, subways, an auditorium using collapsible chairs); and (4) A chair without armrests and a table (some chairs in restaurants, chairs in front of desks in some offices).  In situations involving #1, the “lap tray” should have adaptations on the sides which allow it to rest upon the arm rests.  In case the user crosses his leg (which causes a knee to be raised), the design should allow some degree of elevation above the level of the top of the arm rests.  It should be noted that this option would be extremely beneficial to the airline and theatre industry.  Airlines would not be able to retrofit their aircraft to have this approach as a built-in component.  In movie theaters, any emitted light may be disturbing to others, so it would be wise for theater owners have such users sit in the back.  In situations involving #2, a difficulty arises because much of the chair arm rests will end up beneath the surface of the table which the user is facing.  Here, the user could simply move close to the table and rest the “lap tray” on top of the table.  Or, the “lap tray” could remain attached the arm rests, but only at the point closest to the user.  If the “lap tray” is elevated a bit, the user would be able to move toward the table and the “lap tray” would move in tandem and end up above the table’s surface.  However, this will become a problem if the user has to use a computer at the table, or write at the table or eat at the table.  In such circumstances the “lap tray” would be in the way.  The only conceivable way to address this would be to enable the “lap tray” to be split in the middle.  The two pieces would be placed on the table, facing each other.  This would not afford the same degree of protection as when resting on arm rests, but it would help. In situations involving #3, a user could, of course, simply place the “lap tray” on their lap.  However, since a person usually shift’s their body while seated, it may be difficult to keep it perfectly situated.  At least one hand would need to hold it, constantly.  One way to address this would be to simply have a strap around the neck attach to it, at the device’s most distal points (left and right).  A foam pillow of some type, to rest under the “lap tray”, might also help a bit.  Retractable legs for the “lap tray” might be considered, but they might cause someone who passes by to trip.  In situations involving #4, they would have to be addressed in a manner as described for #2, above, namely dividing the device in half.   Note that an ambulatory person could carry a “lap tray” from one setting to another with a shoulder strap.\r\n\r\nAll of the above mentioned negative ion, UVC and Far UVC options would clean the air immensely and, of great importance, would be so visible that the public would feel more assured.  The public could continue wearing masks, but there would be less fear in these settings where any of these options presented from the beginning of this write-up to this point are seen in use.  \r\n\r\nSince manufacturers are already making negative ion generators, UVC and Far UVC components, they do not need any encouragement in their development production of devices that already exist.  However, what is needed is a high-level request from the government to consider making the types of devices as described above.  Such a request would be magnified even further if all of the industries that have been severely affected by Covid-19 were to clamor for the production of such options.  They would know that if these systems were in place, their employees would be safer and the public would feel far safer in patronizing them. \r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the cost of placing any of the above systems in offices, schools, restaurants, or in the hands of patients/consumers to a degree to where they would be truly effective would be sky high.   That is where the Federal government may need to use the Defense Production Act, offer tax deductions, etc.  Mass installations and or individual unit distributions could effectively serve as a infrastructure measure.     \r\n\r\nThe following links support the use of negative ions: \r\n\r\nSuccessful study with viruses:  https://www.nature.com/articles/srep11431 \r\n\r\nIonizer destroys acinobacter in hospital:  https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn3228-air-ionisers-wipe-out-hospital-infections/ \r\n\r\nAn aircraft ionization system:  https://www.ainonline.com/aviation-news/business-aviation/2015-10-09/ionization-system-removes-pathogens-cabin-air\r\n\r\nActive against Salmonella:  https://agresearchmag.ars.usda.gov/2000/mar/salm\r\n\r\nA listing of studies compiled by a manufacturer:  https://www.surroundair.com/negative-ions/\r\n\r\nEffective against Newcastle virus:  https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2130090/pdf/jhyg00043-0066.pdf  \r\n\r\nEffective with viruses:\r\nhttps://www.researchgate.net/publication/279065550_Ionizing_air_affects_influenza_virus_infectivity_and_prevents_airborne-transmission\r\n\r\nhttps://lynnemctaggart.com/getting-rid-of-the-corona-virus-with-thin-air/\r\n\r\nRole with antibody treatment:\r\nhttps://www.fortuneindia.com/ideas/new-treatment-may-cure-covid-19-in-48-hours/104485\r\n\r\nUse in hospitals:\r\nhttps://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/hospitals-to-get-negative-ion-generators-to-fight-covid-19/articleshow/74902482.cms\r\n\r\nExample of Bipolar ionization:\r\nhttps://www.traveltechtoday.com/2020/03/05/connecticut-company-put-positive-negative-ions-to-work-against-coronavirus/\r\n\r\nPlasmacluster ions – effective against viruses:  \r\nhttps://phys.org/news/2004-07-inactivate-airborne-virus-withplasma.html\r\nhttps://global.sharp/pci/en/certified/pdf/viruses_01.pdf\r\n\r\nA few available products:\r\nhttps://www.lightair.com/the-virus-prevention-invention/\r\nhttps://www.greenlodgingnews.com/connecticut-company-put-ions-to-work-against-coronavirus/\r\n\r\nSupport in Scotland:  \r\nhttps://www.thenational.scot/news/18351414.coronavirus-ionisers-may-key-fight-defeat-covid-19/\r\n\r\nNonthermal Plasma Reactor (Cold Plasma) – an advancec negative ion generator – Effective against viruses:  \r\nhttps://www.agweb.com/article/can-nonthermal-plasma-inactivate-airborne-viral-threat-pigs\r\n\r\nThis discusses only ozone:  http://www.china.org.cn/opinion/2020-02/26/content_75747237_4.htm ; https://www.ozonepartner.com/poultry\r\n \r\nThe following links support the use of UVC:\r\n https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20200325-covid-19-the-history-of-pandemics ;    https://www.digitaltrends.com/news/can-uv-light-kill-coronavirus/ ;  https://www.rfsafe.com/207-222-nm-uvc-light-can-slow-spread-of-novel-coronavirus-covid-19/ ; https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-21058-w  .  \r\n\r\nThe following links support the use of UVC:\r\nhttps://www.news.ucsb.edu/2020/019860/power-light ; https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/uvglo-the-world-s-smartest-uv-c-led-sterilizer#/ ; https://news.columbia.edu/ultraviolet-technology-virus-covid-19-UV-light ; https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/07/former-nasa-scientist-wants-to-fight-coronavirus-with-ultraviolet-light.html\r\n\r\n\r\n",

      "description":"The following concept, involving the use of negative ions (created by small, wearable negative ion generators), has the potential to greatly limit the airborne transmission of Covid-19 within indoor settings.  More specifically, it involves the immediate air space of a person’s mouth and nose while indoors.      \r\n\r\nIn a nutshell, the negative ions weigh down any particulates in the air (including microorganisms) and cause them to fall to the ground.  Furthermore, there is research which indicates that negative ions can kill viruses outright.  If the negative ions from negative ion generators can indeed have these effects, they have great potential for limiting the exposure of people in buildings to any airborne Covid-19 in the area.  It is the indoor environment where the threat from airborne transmission is the highest, as Covid-19 does not do well in sunlight or in hot temperatures.     \r\n\r\nStand-alone negative ion generators, made primarily for home use, have been in existence for many years.  Of particular interest in presenting this idea are the versions companies have made which can be worn around the neck, as shown here:  https://www.npr.org/2016/05/12/477836061/in-polluted-india-negative-ion-necklaces-vow-to-help-you-breathe-easier ; http://www.businessworld.in/article/Air-Tamer-A-310-The-Personal-Air-Purifier-Device-Review/16-08-2019-174880/ ;  https://thegadgetflow.com/portfolio/wearable-air-purifier/ ; https://newatlas.com/sponsored-content/air-purifier-airbox-portable-indoor/ ; https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/constantinnov/airbox-more-powerful-than-hepa-purifiers (small, but not designed for wearing; this one also incorporates UV light).   \r\n\r\nNegative ion generators have been mentioned very sparsely during the Covid-19 pandemic, even with the reported benefits.  Despite their negligible use, to date, there is sufficient research available (see later text) to suggest that active consideration of them in a smaller, portable form as a viable weapon against Covid-19 is merited.  \r\n\r\nAs indicated above, various companies have already invented wearable negative ion generators.  It is unknown whether or not these devices, if used as intended, would actually work.  In determining what would work, two specific concerns should be kept in mind.  First, we would want enough negative ions in the vicinity of a person’s mouth and nose on a constant basis to greatly inhibit the inhalation of live Covid-19 (in case a wearer is not infected).  This desired coverage area would be less than what is needed for exhalations.  Ideally, with a wearable negative ion generator, any Covid-19 lingering in the air would have already been neutralized if it had drifted near the face.  This assumes an indoor environment without a fan blowing nearby, or situations where a person is not walking.  Walking would quickly bring a person into new “environments” where any wearable negative ion device would not have time to have an effect on inhaled (or exhaled) air.  Second, in cases where a wearer is already infected, we would want coverage in the area beyond the mouth and nose where any virus particles from at least shallow or deep exhalations, or speaking, can be expected to reach before they attain a “lingering” or “drifting” status.  This would seem to pose more of a challenge than coverage of inhalations.  It seems reasonable to assume that the immediate dispersal area of a shallow or deep exhalation, or the act of speaking, would be considerably less than that of a sneeze or cough.  But once something has been expelled into the air, irrespective of the velocity in which it was done, it can stay in the air and eventually waft away many feet away from the person who exhaled.  As indicated above, this means we should strive for coverage of any area where an exhalation would tend to start lingering, while the person exhaling is sitting or standing still.  Thus, a larger coverage area than what would be needed for inhalations.  It would be too much to expect coverage of cough and sneeze particles; such acts can be addressed by another unique strategy (not discussed here).  \r\n\r\nHaving concluded that we need a coverage area to address exhalations and speaking, which would likely surpass the coverage area needed for inhalations, we would also have to consider whether or not a person is wearing a mask or respirator.  Since there is no guarantee that a person wearing the proposed device will simultaneously be wearing a face covering, the goal should be to address an uncovered face.  However, if exhalations of people wearing face coverings escape from the sides, the trajectories of such exhalations should also be taken into account.  \r\n\r\nI have thus far suggested avenues for study.  It is unknown as of this writing whether or not the current portable negative ion generators on the market, where negative ion generators rest on the chest, would meet these expectations.  If they do, that’s great; let’s get more of them to the general public and simply adapt them with the design considerations discussed below.  However, I suspect they do not meet our expectations.  Therefore, I suggest the following:  (1) Design a version which can be worn like a telephone headset.  In this form, the negative ion generator would be positioned very close to the mouth and nose (similar to where a telephone headset microphone is located), not on the upper chest as in existing models.  This should bring maximum protection to where it is needed.  However, instead of having one negative ion generator positioned at the end of a headset arm, there would be two headset arms to respectively accommodate negative ion generators.  Another option would be to design a version somewhat similar to telephone holders that rest on the shoulder (     http://blog.modernmechanix.com/telephone-holder-is-curved-to-fit-contour-of-shoulder/ ) or chest (  https://www.urbanoutfitters.com/shop/adjustable-neck-smartphone-mount?inventoryCountry=US\u0026color=001\u0026size=ONE%20SIZE\u0026gclid=EAIaIQobChMItqXeoYXL6QIVGMDICh3_bgPCEAQYHCABEgIoDfD_BwE\u0026gclsrc=aw.ds\u0026type=REGULAR\u0026quantity=1 ).   In these examples, it is envisioned that the negative ion generators would also be positioned close to the mouth and nose.  In whatever design is chosen, the negative ion generators should not be directly in front of the mouth and nose.  If they are instead positioned to the side a bit, the wearer would be able to eat without having to remove the device.  (2) Concurrent with #1, above, studies should be performed on a rough prototype to confirm whether or not sufficient protection is afforded to the wearer (for inhalation) and others nearby (for exhalation).  If the latter is a bit deficient and it would be impossible to ramp up the power, research should factor in whether or not any Covid-19 which escaped entrapment or killing during an exhalation would be likely to also survive attempted inhalation by someone nearby who is also wearing a device.   (3) If a respected entity concludes after steps #1 and #2 that these devices could indeed be a significant contribution in the fight against Covid-19, I would envision that wearable, high capacity units that do not emit ozone could be mass produced and made available to the public.  I would urge that the Federal government put out bids for their manufacture.   \r\n\r\nI should mention that another one of my concepts concerned the development of a face shield which partially consisted of Far UVC light, which can kill viruses in the air.  It might be worthwhile to consider adding Far UVC light in the vicinity of the dual negative ion generators, to form a “wall” that would kill Covid-19 in the process of being inhaled or any Covid-19 which is exhaled.  However, for inhalation, we cannot assume that air would enter in a straight line.  The inhaled air would come primarily what is in the immediate vicinity of the mouth or nostrils.  Therefore, for inhalation purposes, Far UVC lights would have to be positioned far enough away to “paint” the mouth and nose area, covering an area which would contain air that is likely to be inhaled.  Thus, it would not be two feet out, but perhaps inches out.  The light would also have to be like a spotlight, not a fine and narrow laser outlining a defined area.  Since Far UVC does not harm humans, one could argue that it should be pointed directly at the above mentioned facial areas.  But to be safe, a side to side illumination (headset arm to headset arm) might be better.  As for exhalation, we would need to see if the arrangement for inhalation would address the propulsive nature of an exhalation.  An exhalation would need to persist in the immediate vicinity long enough for the Far UVC to have an effect.  This may not be possible; research would tell.  However, an application of Far UVC to address inhalation might work.   \r\n\r\nAll we need at this stage is for someone to confirm whether or not the overall concept has merit and, if so, initiate efforts for mass production and distribution.  If this were to take place, all types of health care settings, work settings and entertainment/dining settings would be much safer for the people who work there.  They would also increase public confidence in the safety of such settings and, in turn, increase public patronage at such sites.  And that will be a tremendous boost to the economy.   \r\n\r\nThe following are some pertinent links to help consider this concept:  \r\n\r\nSuccessful study with viruses:  https://www.nature.com/articles/srep11431 \r\n\r\nIonizer destroys acinobacter in hospital:  https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn3228-air-ionisers-wipe-out-hospital-infections/ \r\n\r\nAn aircraft ionization system:  https://www.ainonline.com/aviation-news/business-aviation/2015-10-09/ionization-system-removes-pathogens-cabin-air\r\n\r\nActive against Salmonella:  https://agresearchmag.ars.usda.gov/2000/mar/salm\r\n\r\nA listing of studies compiled by a manufacturer:  https://www.surroundair.com/negative-ions/\r\n\r\nEffective against Newcastle virus:  https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2130090/pdf/jhyg00043-0066.pdf  \r\n\r\nEffective with viruses:\r\nhttps://www.researchgate.net/publication/279065550_Ionizing_air_affects_influenza_virus_infectivity_and_prevents_airborne-transmission\r\n\r\nhttps://lynnemctaggart.com/getting-rid-of-the-corona-virus-with-thin-air/\r\n\r\nRole with antibody treatment:\r\nhttps://www.fortuneindia.com/ideas/new-treatment-may-cure-covid-19-in-48-hours/104485\r\n\r\nUse in hospitals:\r\nhttps://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/hospitals-to-get-negative-ion-generators-to-fight-covid-19/articleshow/74902482.cms\r\n\r\nExample of Bipolar ionization:\r\nhttps://www.traveltechtoday.com/2020/03/05/connecticut-company-put-positive-negative-ions-to-work-against-coronavirus/\r\n\r\nPlasmacluster ions – effective against viruses:  \r\nhttps://phys.org/news/2004-07-inactivate-airborne-virus-withplasma.html\r\nhttps://global.sharp/pci/en/certified/pdf/viruses_01.pdf\r\n\r\nA few available products:\r\nhttps://www.lightair.com/the-virus-prevention-invention/\r\nhttps://www.greenlodgingnews.com/connecticut-company-put-ions-to-work-against-coronavirus/\r\n\r\nSupport in Scotland:  \r\nhttps://www.thenational.scot/news/18351414.coronavirus-ionisers-may-key-fight-defeat-covid-19/\r\n\r\nNonthermal Plasma Reactor (Cold Plasma) – an advancec negative ion generator – Effective against viruses:  \r\nhttps://www.agweb.com/article/can-nonthermal-plasma-inactivate-airborne-viral-threat-pigs\r\n\r\nThis discusses only ozone:  http://www.china.org.cn/opinion/2020-02/26/content_75747237_4.htm ; https://www.ozonepartner.com/poultry \r\n",

We’re at the height of human technology and innovation, but at the same time facing one of the most devastating viral pandemics in history. The economy is suffering, countries around the world are facing mandatory lockdown orders and hospitals are overwhelmed. Despite this, many people are still unaware of the seriousness of COVID-19 and actions they can take to support our health care professionals such as social distancing to flatten the health care demand curve. Reducing the doubling rate of COVID-19 by even a few days can have massive impact. Can we use a high stakes social game to help inspire the youth to stop the virus?\r\n\r\nThis social game was inspired by the TV show Survivor (Watch before reading more). It's a game based on fun challenges, alliances and human psychology. The twist here is that instead of being stranded on a deserted island for 30 days, players are \"stranded\" inside their homes. This is important because social distancing, i.e. staying home, is the best tool that the youth have right now for collectively fighting the epidemic. All challenges in this game are designed to incentivize social distancing and spreading awareness. Simple activities like making home made cotton based masks can help reduce droplet based transmission rates by up to 70% and can be turned into social awareness challenges. Young and healthy people are at risk and can engage in activities that can increase risk for others, so the goal is to create home-based activities that reward risk mitigation.\r\n\r\nAlso, since the game is digital and based on social media, we aren't limited to the standard 20 players. Everyone can play. With the hope of attracting even more players and convincing them to socially distance, a donation is required to join and the winner takes all.",

      "name":"Improvements in UVC and Far UVC approaches to help reduce the airborne transmission of Covid-19. ",
      "description":"By now, many who have been following the development of Covid-19 have become aware that UVC light (or Germicidal UV) can kill it, on surfaces and in the air.  Since UVC light is harmful to humans, it is difficult to see it having a role in settings where people can easily be exposed to it.  Thus, I will not be discussing any attempts to clean person-level surfaces by UVC light while people may be in the vicinity.  However, its role in cleaning the air will be discussed in depth.   An alternative option, Far UVC, will be brought up in later text. \r\n\r\nUVC light has been used for many years to eradicate microorganisms from the air of buildings.  Units are usually installed within duct work, or on walls at least seven feet from the ground with shielding to prevent eye damage to people nearby (upper air irradiation).   The wall unit lights point outward at an angle and upward, often towards a ceiling air vent.  The following describes these type of arrangements:  https://www.achrnews.com/articles/141736-how-hvac-can-help-prevent-the-spread-of-contagious-diseases  .\r\n\r\nIf a building has units as described above, it is already having an effect on the airborne transmission of Covid-19.  Perhaps the effectiveness of what a building has established can be verified by testing.  However, there may be ways to improve the quality of their respective campaigns even further.  In addition, in buildings where no such systems are in place, possibly due to costs, there may be ways to bring them into the fold through other approaches.  I will be proposing approaches to address these two situations (increasing current UVC  measures or starting UVC measures) that will not only attain the respective goals, but also have the added benefit of being publicly visible.  The visibility of UVC efforts (evident in the preceding only in upper air irradiation) is extremely important, for it will give the public greater confidence that various settings are indeed safe from the perspective of airborne transmission.  This, in turn, will have a tremendous effect on the economy.  I cannot stress this point enough.\r\n\r\nIt is reasonable to assume that if the owners of a building wanted to install the above mentioned systems, they would do so.  However, they may be deterred by the costs.  The main high level expenses would likely involve expensive wiring.  I therefore propose that manufacturers be urged to create UVC options which could adapt to existing fixture or wall outlet placements.  \r\n\r\nLet us first consider ceiling light fixtures.  They would generally fall into the following categories:  (1) recessed bulbs; (2) bubs in fixtures that are close to the ceiling; (3) hanging light fixtures; and (4) recessed, long bulb fluorescent light fixtures.  There might be a few more types, but this should suffice for our discussion.  The height of ceilings should also be taken into account and will be touched upon, below.  \r\n\r\nYou can’t simply replace the current bulbs involved in #1 - #4, above, used for lighting, and install a UVC bulb or fixture.  Such a replacement would, of course, have to be pointed upwards.  Yes, it would provide protection, but the inhabitants of the room below would have lost a good amount of their needed illumination.  The solution would be to create hybrid fixtures which would piggyback onto the existing fixtures.   For example, with #1, a screw in connection to the existing bulb receptacle would hang down and feed power into a new fixture, below, which would have been attached to the ceiling.  This new fixture would have a UVC component, shining upwards and laterally in a manner which cannot be seen by people below.  On the bottom side would be the bulb for illumination.  This whole fixture would be stabilized by non-obtrusive struts connecting on the lower surface of the ceiling.  If the ceiling had fire prevention tiles, a way to attach to the visible tile holders would need to be devised, without having a negative impact on the integrity of the tile system.  Whatever is designed would need to meet fire code standards.  As for #2 fixtures, they would be addressed in a manner similar to #1.  With #3, the hanging fixtures would remain at the same level, but a UVC fixture would be added higher up.  There would need to be some assurance that the UVC light would not tilt if it is not attached to the ceiling.  As for #4, a new fixture would need to be suspended from the ceiling just below it.  UVC bulbs (with proper shielding) would be installed in the recessed fixture.  The wiring would need to be fixed so that both lamps would be powered.  \r\n\r\nAssuming all of the original fixtures were reasonably spaced from one another, the suggested alterations would provide good UVC coverage close to the ceiling.  That is good for that part of the room, but the protective effect would be much better if the “dirty” air from below circulates up to the ceiling area for cleaning.  Any vents already in the ceiling would help effect this.  So would ceiling fans, which may need to be installed in tandem with the above mentioned fixtures.  This would probably not be a problem in low-ceiling rooms.  However, if the involved room had a very high ceiling and a broad expanse, this would be difficult to imagine happening.   One thing which could help in high ceiling situations would be long pipes extending downward from the ceiling and terminating in light fixtures.  These pipes could have openings on the lower end designed to suck air upwards and dispel it in the ceiling area to be hit by the UVC.  Although conceivably workable, the cost would likely be excessive.    \r\n\r\nThus far we have spoken about ceiling fixtures.  And we are already aware of conventional upper air irradiation.  If a room had a very high ceiling and outlets were available on the wall, it might be possible to create an artfully disguised stacking of traditional upper air irradiation devices, from a height of seven feet on the wall on up.  Then, in order to get air fed into the units, we would have built into this array a long “pipe” suction system behind the lights.  This would suck in a high volume of air for cleaning.  It would exit at the top.  Or, if it is possible, piping from a major design component or sculpture at ground level in the center of the room could circulate air from that site, beneath the floor and then upward into the stacked array.  This would likely cost a bit.  \r\n\r\nSo far, I have presented options involving open areas with high or low ceilings.  I will now discuss how the air could be further cleaned by a different type of light, Far UVC, to the benefit of people sitting at tables, desks or standing at counters.  If added to the above discussed options, a building would appear to be capable of making the airborne transmission of Covid-19 virtually impossible.  This options would also go far in reinforcing in the public mind that the risk of contracting Covid-19 there would be extremely low.  \r\n\r\nNow, a little background on Far UVC light.  I will be borrowing a bit from what I had written elsewhere for another idea.\r\n\r\nFirst, UVC light as discussed above is harmful to humans.  It is not safe to look into such a light.  There is however, an alternative :  Far UVC.  It has the same very rapid killing effect, but research so far suggests that it will not harm the human body.  The following provides insights on UVC:    https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20200325-covid-19-the-history-of-pandemics ;    https://www.digitaltrends.com/news/can-uv-light-kill-coronavirus/ ;  https://www.rfsafe.com/207-222-nm-uvc-light-can-slow-spread-of-novel-coronavirus-covid-19/ ; https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-21058-w  .  This suggests the Far-UVC can be emitted by LED:  https://www.news.ucsb.edu/2020/019860/power-light ; https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/uvglo-the-world-s-smartest-uv-c-led-sterilizer#/ ;  If Far UVC can be made with LED, then the design of what follows will be augmented.\r\n\r\nAlthough Far UVC light is said to not harm eyes, out of an abundance of caution I am proposing options that will not involve a steady shining of the light into people’s faces.  \r\n\r\nI propose the following:  (1) Far UVC lamps could be designed for placement in the center of tables, as a fixture.  They would be angled downward so that the light would terminate at the table’s edge.  This would have a direct effect on the air in the immediate vicinity of dines.  (2) Far UVC lamps could also be designed for placement on counters, such as at banks and the indoor pick-up window in a restaurant.  These would be angled downward in a manner similar to #1 and also only shine to the left and right.  (3)  If there was a guarantee that a setting would not allow children, such as bars and nightclubs, Far UVC could shine from walls, columns and barriers from the ground up to about four feet.  (4) Salad bars could have horizontal lights which shine away from the customer, at an angle, along the entire length of the salad bar (at waist level).  This could also be done with conference tables.  (5) Upward pointed, horizontal Far UVC lamps could be affixed along the upper borders of office cubicles.  (6) Far UVC lamps could outline the entrance to an office door, effectively cleaning any air which drifts in or out. (7) Since stays in elevators are relatively short, consideration could be given to downward pointed Far UVC lights in elevator ceilings.\r\n\r\nAll of the above mentioned UVC and Far UVC options would clean the air immensely and, of great importance, would be so visible that the public would feel more assured.  The public could continue wearing masks, but there would be less fear in these settings.\r\n\r\nSince manufacturers are already making UVC and Far UVC components, they do not need any encouragement in their development of particular fixtures.  However, what is needed is a high-level request from the government to consider making the types of devices as described above.  Such a request would be magnified even further if all of the industries that have been severely affected by Covid-19 were to clamor for the production of such options.  They would know that if these systems were in place their employees would be safer and the public would feel far safer in patronizing them.    \r\n\r\n\r\n",

      "description":"As things currently stand with Covid-19, surgical masks and N95 respirators are discussed the most with respect to reducing the airborne spread of Covid-19.  Despite their predominance in both discussions and actual use, it has to be remembered that surgical masks are intended to protect the environment and that it is the N95 respirators which are more protective of the wearer.  The latter option has a disadvantage in that it is difficult for most people to wear for long periods of time.  This presentation is made with the understanding that both options (or homemade alternatives) will dominate in public settings.  \r\n\r\nIt seems that the risk of exposure to airborne Covid-19 would, generally speaking, be higher pretty much anywhere within indoor settings or in very close proximity to someone in an outdoor setting.   Outdoor settings tend to be safer due to the effect of the sun and any humidity on the virus, as well as breezes which can rapidly disperse it.  When we further break down the mechanisms, in relation to transmission risk,  by which Covid-19 can be transmitted, we realize that it can, at the low level be caused by normal exhalations.  It will be increased with speaking, further increased to a significant degree by coughing and then reach the paramount level of risk with sneezing.  Logic dictates that if the risk of any transmission from these causes can be reduced, we will have a lower rate of airborne transmission and thus a lower infection rate.\r\n\r\nIf we assume that most (or all) people in various settings will be wearing the above-mentioned options, it would be unreasonable to expect them to not exhale normally or speak at normal levels.  And it would be difficult to get them to wear even more protective facial coverings due to the fact that most of such alternatives will significantly impair verbal communication.  One would not think that such low-risk activities (while wearing the above-mentioned options) would merit much concern.  Some may assume that they can even cough or sneeze without risk to others while wearing these aids.  However, it is with these two higher-risk activities where we will have a significant problem, not only (and quite obviously) without surgical masks or N95 respirators, but with them.  I will be proposing a solution to this danger  which will not require a constant facial covering beyond what I have mentioned.\r\n\r\nFirst, a brief overview of the risks inherent in coughing and sneezing.  \r\n\r\nThis video, from Aalto university, shows how far particles from a cough can spread:    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZSKoNGTR6Q  This is informative: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKAHNoni0KI \r\nThe study which is most concerning is this one https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3846148/#!po=45.3704  .  It essentially makes the point that current cough etiquette measures, including mask use, are not as effective as once thought. It read, in part:  “Acquired data suggests that in the case of an individual infected with a highly pathogenic microorganism, infectious cough droplets would still be released to the surrounding environment when covering the mouth/nose with any of the assessed respiratory maneuvers, allowing the probability of infecting susceptible individuals.”  \r\n\r\nIt appears that the main problem with masks is that the force of air which is expelled, particularly during a sneeze, escapes from the sides.  One might surmise that the way to resolve this is for the masks to adhere much closer to the face along its edges.   This would require an excessive degree of tightness, something which most people cannot endure for long.\r\n\r\nIt should be easy to understand why the force of a sneeze propels droplets to the outside air via the edges of a mask.  Just look at the average mask; it is held relatively close to the face.  This means that if a large exhalation (as in a sneeze) comes forth, it does not go into a large enough receptacle to contain it.  Now, if a mask had a receiving volume of, say, the size of an airplane emeses bag (the bag for vomiting), it would likely retain all of the force of a sneeze with minimal or no leakage from the sides.  And, if concurrent with a sneeze the borders of the mask could somehow be completely pressed against the face, any leakage would be reduced to negligible amounts.  But no such arrangement exists with masks.  Wearing a mask with the volume as just described would be quite cumbersome and we still would not have a way to stop leakage from the sides, due to the inability of people to endure the tightness which would be required.  \r\nIt should be noted that there have been various inventions over the years for devices to “catch” coughs or sneezes, such as these:  https://patents.google.com/patent/US20110088132A1/en ; https://www.improbable.com/2015/03/23/sneeze-catcher-new-patent/ ; https://www.neatorama.com/2017/05/23/Engineering-Against-Coughing-and-Sneezing/ .\r\n\r\nThe answer is this:  a portable “sneeze catcher” which people could wear on a lanyard or belt for quick access.  Although it would have similarities to previously invented sneeze catchers, it would be notable for combining the following qualities.  First, its rubber-type seal against the face would conform roughly to the wearer’s face contour, when pressed against it by the wearer.  This should enable a brief, tight seal during a sneeze and would thus greatly limit any airflow exiting through the sides.  Considerations would need to be made for if a person is wearing a N95 respirator at the time of an impending sneeze.  Second, the sneeze catcher would have three handles:  one extending downward (like a lollipop) and two on the sides.  This would enable a one or two handed person to exert enough pressure to maintain a good seal.  Third, each handle could be squeezed to open a panel of some type which would normally cover the receiving area of a sneeze.  Perhaps the panel could slide down, or there could be an iris type of “panel.”  This would “engage” the sneeze catcher for use.  When a sneeze is completed, the panel should be quickly closed to retain what was expelled in the confined area.  Fourth, we need to consider the volume of the sneeze “receiving area” and how it would be designed.  As discussed previously, the receiving area should be reasonably large, but not be cumbersome to the wearer while not in use.   It therefore needs to be restrained or contracted while not in use.  It can’t be hanging and flapping about.  If you were to visualize it, the area would act like a balloon when receiving a sneeze; it would expand.  However, unlike a balloon, the force of a sneeze probably would not be enough to overcome the “tightness” of the area while it is at rest and subsequently initiate expansion.  Therefore, the best option for getting the balloon effect would be for the receiving area to expand at the same time as the above mentioned panel slides open, through mechanical means.  The receiving area should use a framework of sorts which would expand in the manner like a Hoberman sphere, accordion or iris. This arrangement would require “fabric” being connected to the framework.  Fifth, the interior and exterior of the sneeze catcher would need to be coated with a virucidal material, of which there are many on the market.  \r\n\r\nIn the proposed use, when a person feels they are about to sneeze or cough, they would: raise this to their nose and mouth; press firmly against the face for a good seal; squeeze the handle to open the receiving chamber entrance and expand the dimensions of the overall receiving area; sneeze; then reverse the process.  All contents of the sneeze would be retained and the virus would be killed when it touches the inner walls.  As a supplement, there might be a way, after a sneezing bout, to spray through a port into the chamber to further disinfect it.  \r\n\r\nIn order to significantly impact Covid-19, it would be preferred that in order for a person to gain access to stores, schools, offices, buses, etc. they would need to be in possession of one of these devices.  This would require government involvement from the top.  Once these are prevalent, you can have assurance that the public will effectively shame anyone who does not have any obvious infirmities if they sneeze without using it.  \r\n\r\nA supplemental feature which might be added would be a means whereby a person could squeeze a different handle that would enable them to breathe through the device, like a super-strong N95 respirator.  This could come in handy when a person has to walk through an area where they saw someone sneeze in an improper manner.  \r\n",

      "docs_and_demo":"As things currently stand with Covid-19, surgical masks and N95 respirators are discussed the most with respect to reducing the airborne spread of Covid-19.  Despite their predominance in both discussions and actual use, it has to be remembered that surgical masks are intended to protect the environment and that it is the N95 respirators which are more protective of the wearer.  The latter option has a disadvantage in that it is difficult for most people to wear for long periods of time.  This presentation is made with the understanding that both options (or homemade alternatives) will dominate in public settings.  \r\nIt seems that the risk of exposure to airborne Covid-19 would, generally speaking, be higher pretty much anywhere within indoor settings or in very close proximity to someone in an outdoor setting.   Outdoor settings tend to be safer due to the effect of the sun and any humidity on the virus, as well as breezes which can rapidly disperse it.  When we further break down the mechanisms, in relation to transmission risk,  by which Covid-19 can be transmitted, we realize that it can, at the low level be caused by normal exhalations.  It will be increased with speaking, further increased to a significant degree by coughing and then reach the paramount level of risk with sneezing.  Logic dictates that if the risk of any transmission from these causes can be reduced, we will have a lower rate of airborne transmission and thus a lower infection rate.\r\nIf we assume that most (or all) people in various settings will be wearing the above-mentioned options, it would be unreasonable to expect them to not exhale normally or speak at normal levels.  And it would be difficult to get them to wear even more protective facial coverings due to the fact that most of such alternatives will significantly impair verbal communication.  One would not think that such low-risk activities (while wearing the above-mentioned options) would merit much concern.  Some may assume that they can even cough or sneeze without risk to others while wearing these aids.  However, it is with these two higher-risk activities where we will have a significant problem, not only (and quite obviously) without surgical masks or N95 respirators, but with them.  I will be proposing a solution to this danger  which will not require a constant facial covering beyond what I have mentioned.\r\nFirst, a brief overview of the risks inherent in coughing and sneezing.  \r\n\r\nThis video, from Aalto university, shows how far particles from a cough can spread:    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZSKoNGTR6Q  This is informative: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKAHNoni0KI \r\nThe study which is most concerning is this one https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3846148/#!po=45.3704  .  It essentially makes the point that current cough etiquette measures, including mask use, are not as effective as once thought. It read, in part:  “Acquired data suggests that in the case of an individual infected with a highly pathogenic microorganism, infectious cough droplets would still be released to the surrounding environment when covering the mouth/nose with any of the assessed respiratory maneuvers, allowing the probability of infecting susceptible individuals.”  \r\nIt appears that the main problem with masks is that the force of air which is expelled, particularly during a sneeze, escapes from the sides.  One might surmise that the way to resolve this is for the masks to adhere much closer to the face along its edges.   This would require an excessive degree of tightness, something which most people cannot endure for long.\r\nIt should be easy to understand why the force of a sneeze propels droplets to the outside air via the edges of a mask.  Just look at the average mask; it is held relatively close to the face.  This means that if a large exhalation (as in a sneeze) comes forth, it does not go into a large enough receptacle to contain it.  Now, if a mask had a receiving volume of, say, the size of an airplane emeses bag (the bag for vomiting), it would likely retain all of the force of a sneeze with minimal or no leakage from the sides.  And, if concurrent with a sneeze the borders of the mask could somehow be completely pressed against the face, any leakage would be reduced to negligible amounts.  But no such arrangement exists with masks.  Wearing a mask with the volume as just described would be quite cumbersome and we still would not have a way to stop leakage from the sides, due to the inability of people to endure the tightness which would be required.  \r\nIt should be noted that there have been various inventions over the years for devices to “catch” coughs or sneezes, such as these:  https://patents.google.com/patent/US20110088132A1/en ; https://www.improbable.com/2015/03/23/sneeze-catcher-new-patent/ ; https://www.neatorama.com/2017/05/23/Engineering-Against-Coughing-and-Sneezing/ .\r\nThe answer is this:  a portable “sneeze catcher” which people could wear on a lanyard or belt for quick access.

It is based on a combination of an UV-disinfector, multilayer carbon and wool filters. \r\n\r\nDue to the usage of UV-lamps inside the mask sterilizes inhaled air and protects people against being infected with viruses and bacteria. Multilayer carbon and N95 filters provide extra safeguard from different air threats, including ambient (outdoor) air pollution.\r\n\r\nWe are currently working on adding a Breathing Support System and a Communication Support System to the mask which will help a person who wears the mask decrease the level of air resistance and avoid complexity in the communication process that is distinctive for traditional respirators.\r\n\r\nThe next system to be added is a Fit Control System. Its functions are a constant check and notification of the mask untight fit and places where it should be fixed. \r\n\r\nWe also plan to add an Advanced Analytic System to the 3rd prototype. Based on ML algorithms and data collected from temperature and airflow sensors it will provide both: statistical data about breathing parameters and general body condition and predict the development of inflammatory processes.\r\n",

Few allow passing parameters to update these charts. Most of them aren't client-side applications, and some of them rely on third party services to create, update, expand upon, and serve.

Others aren't clear on what data is being loaded in to inform the dashboard.\r\n\r\nThese were built with several misguided assumptions that forsake the broader need.

Qu Biologics, a Phase 2 clinical stage private biotech company based in Vancouver, has developed a first-in-class immunotherapy platform, Site Specific Immunomodulation (SSI), that enables activation of innate immunity in a safe and targeted way.  This is particularly important in high risk groups such as the elderly, immunosuppressed and those with other chronic illnesses, since these groups have reduced innate immunity and therefore are very susceptible to infection, morbidity and mortality from COVID-19. \r\n  \r\nWe’ve demonstrated that prophylactic use of Qu’s SSI substantially reduces viral lung infection in animal models, demonstrating proof-of-principle. Qu’s SSIs are ‘clinic ready’ (i.e., more than 360 patients treated with very good safety profile, GMP cell bank, and GMP-production ready). Uniquely positioned to activate our body’s first line of defense against viral infection in a safe and targeted way, we believe that Qu’s SSIs will be transformative in COVID-19 and future viral pandemics (since innate immunity is capable of clearing any viral pathogen, regardless of previous exposure). We are seeking collaboration/licensing/equity funding.",

For our users, it is the difference between having an online screening tool 24/7 that they can understand and being forgotten in quarantine waiting to die. \r\n",

      "description":"Coronavirus (COVID-19) has created dire needs for food banks and community shelters around the world, as well as the people they serve. It's also helped many people rediscover or de-stress through running, a great outdoors social distancing activity. Most runners also participate in races, like 5K's, 10K's, and marathons, which are often used to raise money for their favorite charity or cause.\r\n\r\nInspired by people like Elisha Nochomovitz, a 32-year-old restaurant worker who ran a marathon (26.2 miles) on his 23-foot long balcony while on lockdown in France, and others looking to connect their love for service, running, and social distancing together, we're asking any runners out there to join us in a virtual race for food banks between May 15th - May 17th. You can run any time on any day during that period, but we want everyone to run together and post about it to get #RunForFoodBanks trending.\r\n\r\nYour race course can be your backyard, your balcony, a treadmill, a park that isn't crowded, or anywhere you can maintain proper social distancing. The most important thing is the distancing, running (or walking or wheel-based movement if you need it), and making a positive difference.\r\n\r\nAll we ask is you donate your \"race entry fee\" to a food bank of your choice if you can. $20 is a good start, or as much as you feel you can give in this time of uncertainty (and if you can't give anything, running and sharing this helps too). What matters most is you're running for an important cause that matters to you, and that's inspiring you and others to be healthy and do our best. Here's a map and list of food banks to get you started, or choose your favorite local organization. Please also RSVP here if you can (it's free) so we can track runners and help get more support for this project: https://britst.com/runforfoodbanks\r\n\r\nThen, run your race, and feel free to post your run on social media (Twitter, Instagram) with the hashtag #RunForFoodBanks. If you tag us, we'll also plant one tree for every completed race.\r\n\r\nIf you're interested in partnering with us on #RunForFoodBanks to help spread the word, match race donations, or anything else, please get in touch.",

      "description":"I am proposing a blending of existing technologies to create a hopefully lightweight device which could enhance the protective capabilities of N95 respirators against Covid-19 and perhaps provide sufficient protective benefits as a stand-alone.  This could benefit health care providers and the general population.  In addition to offering protection, it would have an advantage of not impeding the breathing (as the N95 respirator tends to do) or interfering with regular communication (as more advanced alternatives do, see below).  The latter point would assist in many people performing their regular jobs or going about a daily routine.  The system I propose could even be used while eating.  \r\nFirst, some background.  There appears to be some controversy over whether people who are not in a healthcare setting should wear surgical face masks, the more protective N95 respirators, or nothing at all.  Surgical face masks are intended to protect the environment from the wearer (not the other way around) and N95 respirators can offer protection from Covid-19.  The protection rate is about 95%; we need 100%.  Their drawback is that they are difficult to tolerate for a long period of time, as the thick material impedes regular breathing.   Another potential option, not discussed much, are reusable elastomeric respirators (used heavily in various non-healthcare industries - see: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK540078/ ).  For the sake of argument, let’s assume that they give 100% protection.  However, they have a major drawback in that it is difficult to communicate with them.  There are undoubtedly various advanced designs in industry and healthcare involving face shields, such as this:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJ3ANkCeSzE , but we are faced again with communication problems and temperature concerns in various settings.  \r\n For the sake of this discussion, let us assume that people are going to go ahead and try to acquire some type of covering, including N95 respirators.  If they go for reusable elastomeric respirators or other advanced options, they would have to contend with their significant drawbacks in the everyday world.  The focus here is with augmenting face masks and N95 respirators.\r\nAs an overview of my concept, I propose a “face shield”, where the “shield” consists of an air curtain combined with Far UVC light.   It would follow the general outline of a traditional face shield, but would weigh a bit more (hopefully not too much) and might require a supplemental power pack, which could be worn over the shoulder.  Essentially, people would carry these about in similar manner which the people in London did with gas masks during the Blitz (   https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/gas-masks-1930s-wwii-europe-chemical-warfare-homefront ).\r\nNow, a little background on Far UVC light.  First, when thinking of a virus-killing light, people generally think of ultraviolet (UVC) light.  It is already being used to kill Covid-19 on various objects.  Despite its high degree of effectiveness, prolong exposure to humans is harmful.  There is however, an alternative :  Far UVC.  It has the same very rapid killing effect, but research so far suggests that it will not harm the human body.  In order to ensure that the proposed UVC/Air Curtain face shield does not expose the body to any risk in this regard, it incorporates special design considerations.  The following provides insights on UVC:    https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20200325-covid-19-the-history-of-pandemics ;    https://www.digitaltrends.com/news/can-uv-light-kill-coronavirus/ ;  https://www.rfsafe.com/207-222-nm-uvc-light-can-slow-spread-of-novel-coronavirus-covid-19/ ; https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-21058-w  .  This suggests the Far-UVC can be emitted by LED:  https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/uvglo-the-world-s-smartest-uv-c-led-sterilizer#/ .  This company ha regular UVC emitted by LED:  https://www.larsonelectronics.com/ .  If Far-UVC can indeed be made with LED, then the design of our proposed Far-UVC / Air Screen Face Shield will be easier to construct.  Otherwise, it will not be so easy.\r\nThe other main component is an air curtain.  Air curtains are basically a series of air jets or a single air vent which shoots downward from an upper frame.  There is nothing to prevent upward or side-based jets, but downward jets seem more appropriate to our situation.  Here is an example where they have been used against insect vectors:   https://berner.com/news/hvac-industrys-air-curtains-expected-help-u-s-fight-oncoming-mosquito-borne-zika-virus-see-httpwww-healthcarefacilitiestoday-compostshvac-industrys-air-curtains-expected-help-u/ .  The reason  that the concept of an air curtain is being thrown into the mix in this presentation is because Covid-19 seems to stay in the air for quite some time.  There is dispute as to whether or not someone would have to be in the vicinity of an infected person who has sneezed, coughed or exhaled in a strong manner, but let’s err on the side of caution.  Logic dictates that an air curtain could inhibit the intrusion of Covid-19  into close proximity of a person’s face.  This is actually not an original concept, as the following links indicate that others have thought along these lines in the past:     http://www.tuvie.com/breathe-invisible-mask-creates-air-curtain-around-your-nose-and-mouth/ ; https://patents.google.com/patent/CN204191650U/en ; http://www.freepatentsonline.com/y2013/0118506.html ; http://www.freepatentsonline.com/y2005/0061316.html .  \r\nSo we now have a foundation for the concept.  I will presently move to a plausible design.  Mind you, I am completely deficient in artistic ability, so I will try to explain things carefully.  We begin with the basic design of a conventional face shield:  https://www.amdnext.com/face-shield-full-clr-plastic.html#.XoZ0OIhKiUk  .  Visualize this while I continue.  I would envision the coverage area in my concept going a little bit more on the sides (the shield edges would go back a little bit further on the sides).  Next, imagine that the brow area is a bit thicker; it will need to be in order to accommodate the features discussed above.  It is hoped that it is not too thick.  Whatever weight this involves will have to be counterbalanced with weight at the back of the head, where the band wraps around.  Moving along, visualize the bottom and side edges of the traditional face shield.  In my proposal, a border, or frame would come down from the brow band area and both sides (where the visualized edges are) and meet each other by following the horizontal edge of our visualized face shield.  These parts of the frame would be of the same thickness of the brow band in order to incorporate its same features.  Thus, we have a frame of sorts.  Consideration might be given to the two side frames being hinged at a few points, in case the wearer needs to tilt his or her head forward.  The air curtains and Far UVC would emanate from these frames, as will be discussed shortly.  If a person has concerns about Far UVC shining on the side of their head, a fabric of some type could be extended down in a parallel manner inward from the side frames; an air current would keep it flush against the head. \r\nFinally, we put together the key components.  Far UVC would shine downwards in one continuous, highly focused curved line from the horizontal brow band area.  Ideally, the light area here (and in the other parts of the frame) would be distal from the face and the air curtain would be more proximal to the face.  This is because if Covid-19 drifts toward the wearer, it will be killed before being repelled by the air curtain.  That would save someone else from exposure to live Covid-19.   Consideration would need to be given to the vertical  thickness of the illuminated area.  We would need to determine how long an oncoming droplet from a sneeze, expelled, say, from six feet away, would need to travel through this curtain of Far UVC before being killed.  As for Covid-19 wafting in the air, one could suppose that the thickness would be a bit less.  This downward pointed band of light would terminate in the lower edge of the frame as described above.  As for the air curtain, it would be positioned in the same manner as the just described for the Far UVC, but more proximal to the face.  It need not terminate in the lower frame edge.  It would serve to repel any Covid-19 which gets past the Far UVC light shield.  As for the lower frame edge, which would have the same components as the brow band, it would act in the same manner.  Except in its case the Far UVC and air curtain would point toward the chin or neck area.  The side frames, also with the same capabilities, would be directed a very short distance to the side of the head.  We therefore end up with a fully framed face.  The wearer can communicate freely (eat too) and has enhanced protection.\r\nIn prior text I mentioned a hinging of the side frames.  If the side frames are flexed, they would still give protection.  The downward pointed Far UVC would not terminate in the lower, horizontal frame, but it would remain effective.  \r\nIn this design, consideration might be given towards accelerating the air flow when one is walking or outdoors in a breeze.  Some type of device which measures the extent of oncoming airflows could be considered; it might be able to make automatic adjustments.  \r\nAs alluded to above, there would probably be a need for an over the shoulder power source and perhaps a air propulsion source.  \r\nLet’s say that this can indeed be constructed.  If on the regular market it would likely cost in the four figures.  However, a national government would be in a position to have it manufactured at a very low cost.  It would be ideal if these could be mass produced and distributed to everyone.  They should have individual registrations and if a person is caught with one that was not assigned to him or her, there should be a steep penalty.  It could be required that entry to schools, businesses, health care facilities, etc. require a person to wear one of these in order to be admitted.  In essence, we would need to adopt the mindset of the Blitz, as discussed above.  \r\n",

Real time communication and hazard broadcasting with improved data access and transparency on our activity stream laid out in a map-based dashboard quickly enable responders to visualize deployed workers, patients, and points of interest on a map\r\n\r\n2. Unlimited users can access and contribute to uploading different data such as documentation pertaining to a specific site of interest, this can be a quarantined or monitored community-this acts as a repository for important information that includes patient history, travel logs, previous activity and even how much ration or medical support is available within that site.\r\n\r\n3. Real-time supply management allows proper management and delegation of medical professionals on-site with the required supplies, rations, and other critical equipment that is needed at that specific point and time.\r\n\r\n4. The custom integration of 3rd party map-data and geospatial annotation tools on the platform enables multiple parties to quickly mark and draw out points and locations of urgent matters that need to be attended to when there are multiple paramedics or emergency response staff deployed into the field.\r\n\r\n5. Using our integrated cost analysis tool to help assist with financial accounting and auditing  as keeping track of staff, supplies, and other resources being deployed is crucial \r\n\r\nThis is used on the EOC's end to properly manage priorities and evolving incidents. In combination with YodelMe's mobile application and communications, we can deliver a more holistic approach to addressing the relief and support in the countermeasure against COVID-19 or any pandemics in the future. For front-line workers our platform offers the ability to communicate with the back office support team at all times with real-time updates of health status and receive notification when there is an area of hazard or urgent needs such as supply shortage.\r\n\r\nOn the other side of the equation the back office support team are able to access workforce, patients, and points of interest visualized on a map with custom annotation tools providing geofencing for hazardous or quarantine zone setup. Moreover, backoffice will have the ability to broadcast real-time important updates as well as being able to delegate proper supply management with financial and inventory information. The secured real-time personnel and quality monitoring along with the above benefits help facilitate the OODA (observe, orient, decide, act) loop faster as the framework in response to crisis and pandemics. \r\n",

We believe this could potentially reduce total ventilator time, reduce incidence / severity of acute respiratory syndrome (ARDS), and hopefully improve mortality.\r\n\r\nWe have large animal data that proves the safety of this approach and need financing to gather dosing data to use hydroxycholorquine / chloroquine with this drug delivery system so we can move into first in human testing.

      "description":"About this project\r\nWith a population estimated at over 80 million inhabitants, the latest general census of population and housing, the Democratic Republic of the Congo is among the poorest countries on the planet. Its population is growing at an average annual rate of 3.3% and has the highest fertility and mortality rates in the world. Young people represent 50.3% of the population under the age of 15, Chadian society is characterized by a very large predominance of people who are economically deprived and predominantly young (around 60% are under 18).\r\nChina, the united states and other countries on the move are fighting to contain the deadliest epidemic of coronavirus disease ever (COVID-19). Some cases have also been reported in France, the DRC, RWANDA, Senegal…. The epidemic in central Africa seems to have started with the transmission of the virus from infected wild animals to the human population. The virus then spread between humans.\r\n\"This epidemic continues to spread throughout the world, in Africa and in the DRC, prompting a strengthening of awareness and prevention activities. Faced with this ever-increasing threat, the DRC continues to strengthen its surveillance and awareness-raising system\",\r\nThe coronavirus (COVID) has killed more than 10,389 people in several countries around the world and more than 250,856 people infected worldwide since the appearance of the first cases, in the DRC 18 cases confirmed since last March.\r\nAfter China, cases are now multiplying in Italy, united kingdom in the United States Nigeria, in France, in Italy, in Nigeria and even in the DRC etc…. it should be noted that today more than 160 countries are affected by COVID-19\r\nHowever, to date, \"cases\" of coronavirus are recorded on Congolese territory, especially in the city of Kinshasa and in Ituri state, with the risk of having them in other provinces and countries, since this disease continues to progress in Central Africa. The province of North Kivu is not spared in the sense that trips are made every day within the international airport of Njili and that of the city of Goma, contacts between people and trafficking (movement of population) with Rwanda, a neighbor of the North and South Kivu province which is also a victim where today, there are 8 confirmed cases.\r\nIn general, the statistics of contamination cases change from day to day.\r\nFaced with this very dangerous situation, East Eagle Foundation must not remain silent. Drawing on her experience in prevention campaigns, she intends to conduct a prevention and awareness campaign on the danger of the Coronavirus (COVID-19).\r\nUse of Proceeds\r\nOur country registers cases of COVID-19. In this context, our role is to raise awareness in the community because we may have to stop shaking hands, but we can still reach out, substantially and emotionally. Our ability to bring help and hope gives us freedom of action, dispelling feelings of helplessness. It makes us noticeably happier, dispelling feelings of hopelessness. It reminds us that we can have a significant impact, if we are intentional.\r\nThus, while protecting themselves according to the principles of the WHO, the Ministry of Health and our organization, our staff will mobilize and sensitize the community on a few points below in order to reduce the spread of the Coronavirus.\r\n1. What is COVID-19?\r\n2. How is coronavirus transmitted?\r\n3. Who can get coronavirus?\r\n4. How can you protect yourself from COVID-19 infection?\r\n• Wash your hands very often\r\n• Clean surfaces (counters, door handles, etc.)\r\n• Clean objects\r\n• Wash clothes\r\n5. Reduce your contact with people\r\n- Wearing masks.\r\n- Monitor your health\r\nThis grant will allow us to make a big impact within the community in order to stop the spread of this Coronavirus.\r\nThis amount will survive the transport of the mobilizers, the production of posters and awareness leaflet, communication, production of the report and other urgent or necessary needs for the success of this action.\r\nIn the event that the amount raised increases, we will go from house to house, distributing handwashing kits, masks, advice leaflets, ...

If its high risk, the hospital reach him/her out and coordinate next steps (e.g. carry out the test directly on the parking so he/she doesn’t get in touch with anyone else, minimizing the risk of contagion)\r\n- At the hospital: When the patient arrives, they are requested to fill in the questionnaire outside the building with their mobile phones. If its high risk, then the hospital reach them out to coordinate how will help them (this way its ensured that he/she is not in contact with other patients in the building, minimizing risks not only for the rest of the people but for the patient itself)\r\n \r\nWhat´s coming?\r\n- Next week we are adding a payment method, so once the patient have to carry out any test, there is no need to have contact with an additional person at the hospital to pay.\r\n- After that we will provide a solution for clinics to avoid lines, applying the same technology\r\n1. If the support can be provided through videoconference it will be carried out that way\r\n2. if the patient needs face to face support, he/she will be informed exactly at what time and where he/she must be to minimize all contacts (people with diseases that go to a clinic in many cases face higher risks, if get infected… so that’s why we find so important to help them)\r\n \r\nAnd after that?\r\n- Once we finish with the hospital solution, we will develop a solution for banks to offer loans to Small and Medium Enterprises, which might close if they don’t have access to cash right away. We are already working with some of them on the definitions, and already validated the model with the legal team. There is a way that with our support they can implement it in days!\r\n\r\nAll of these services we are offering it for free, and looking for people that might help us covering the cost (up to now the co-founders have covered it all)",

The materials required to manufacture one unit are less than $1. I think most makerspaces should have the tools needed: a 3D printer, a laser cutter, and scissors – that’s all you need!\r\nI want to get this to as many people who need it as soon as possible, around the world. If you guys have the tools and capacity for it, you can start preparing now, even before we have the final design. It’s a great time to give your printer a tuneup and to stock up on materials so you are ready to start printing as soon as we release the designs.\r\n\r\nIf you have the capacity to help out, please visit the blog post for detailed instructions, as well as information on safety, sterilization and verification: \r\n\r\nhttps://blog.prusaprinters.org/from-design-to-mass-3d-printing-of-medical-shields-in-three-days/?fbclid=IwAR0ZaOb4h9oaOrpdHB398UhWHWU_dJR-tdvLDYqsVTtERwmnxpkJIjB41sY\r\n ",

The main challenges faced by governments have been balancing the need for drastic action with maintaining civil liberties. Tracery strikes an ideal balance between the two. Tracery allows for the rapid shutdown and/or quarantine of locations which have been exposed to COVID-19 within seconds rather than hours. Tracery maintains privacy for its users by exposing the public only to unique user codes, rather than names or addresses.\r\n\r\nHow it works\r\nDuring registration, users are issued a unique ID. Smartphone users who have downloaded Tracery are assigned a QR code that identifies their ID. When they enter a large venue, a doorman with a smartphone (or an automated device) scans their QR code. Upon completion of this “handshake,” information is conveyed to both devices about the risk level of allowing the person to enter the venue, or the person entering the venue. This risk level is calculated by whether the person has been in a contaminated area, and the degrees of separation from someone who has. When someone is put in quarantine or confirmed with COVID-19, this information is submitted to the server by proper authorities and is propagated through the network, allowing for this diagnosis of risk levels. All locations from which the patient has logged visiting through a handshake are conveyed the directive to close and sanitize immediately. Everyone who has been\r\nin a contaminated location is conveyed the message to either sanitize or self quarantine, depending on the degree of separation.\r\nAnticipated problems and solutions\r\nProblem: Not everyone has a smartphone\r\nSolution: Our ID system allows people who do not have a smartphone to be issued physical QR codes. They can be conveyed information by a doorman upon scanning since they cannot receive notifications.\r\nPossible future features\r\n● Using location services or a digital beacon feature to pinpoint to extreme accuracy everyone people have contact with. Due to privacy concerns this will not be implemented until a public desire for it is expressed.",

      "description":"Can you help to create a zero marginal cost, digital thermometer to help contain coronavirus?\r\n\r\nHere's the idea:\r\n\r\n1. Heart rate can be estimated via (webcam) video of someone’s face with high accuracy (even with poor video quality).[1],[2]\r\n2. This heart rate can then be used to estimate core temperature with high accuracy.[3],[4]\r\n3. Fever (body temperature ≥38°C) [5] is the most typical symptom of C19 - in 88% of confirmed cases.[5] (Though some C19 transmission might be asymptomatic[6] and presymptomatic.[7],[8])\r\n4. Can we start an open-source project to create a digital fever thermometer? This could be used as a smartphone app or on the web (ala donottouchyourface.com). A webcam could continuously monitor people’s temperature and alert them to it if they have a fever.\r\n\r\n‘Thermometer Guns’ have drawbacks: they’re more expensive, you need to get close to someone’s head to take temperature, they are not very accurate, they don’t provide continuous measurement- yet it is still used for coronavirus containment.[9]\r\n\r\nThis might be a very cost-effective intervention to diagnose coronavirus.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] \"Detecting Pulse from Head Motions in Video - People.csail.mit ....\" http://people.csail.mit.edu/balakg/pulsefromheadmotion.html.
